    The late twentieth century could well be known as The Second Era of Exploration.
  :Русский: |-
    Поздние годы 20 века могут быть легко известны, как Вторая Эра Исследований.
- :Английский: |-
    An exciting time when human beings uncovered, mapped, navigated, and started civilizing the last frontier: the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    Интересное время, когда люди начали раскрывать, картографировать, управлять и взялись за самую грань: исследование мозга.
- :Английский: |-
    The birth, you might say, of the species Homo sapiens, Sapiens.
  :Русский: |-
    Рождение, можно сказать, Homo Sapiens'a.

    John C.
  :Русский: |-
    Джон Лилли был одним из первых ученых, способных принести обратно, ценную и систематизированную информацию, из просторов "внутренней географии".
- :Английский: |-
    Lilly was one of the first scientists to send back systematic and useful data from his explorations of inner geography.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For his influential exploits along the uncharted frontiers of knowledge, John C.
  :Русский: |-
    За его вдохновляющие подвиги вдоль пограничных берегов знания, до этого не отмеченных на карте, Джон Лилли останется в памяти как героический философ, своего рода Кристофор Колумб сознания.
- :Английский: |-
    Lilly will be seen as an heroic philosopher, a veritable Christopher Columbus of the mind.

    The First Age of Exploration 
  :Русский: |-
    ## Первое Тысячелетие Исследований
- :Английский: |-
    To understand the importance of John Lilly's work, it is useful to review the noble exploits of the First Age of Exploration which began at the end of the fifteenth century (1492).
  :Русский: |-
    Чтобы понять всю важность работ Лилли, полезно пересмотреть основные подвиги Первого Тысячелетия Исследований, который начались в конце 15 века (1492).
- :Английский: |-
    For hundreds of years before Columbus, many sages, pilot scientists, people of skeptical commonsense and street smarts, knew that the Earth was round and that land could be reached by sailing west from Europe.
  :Русский: |-
    В течение столетий, ещё до Колумба, многие мудрецы, "ученые-пилоты" и люди со скептическими взглядами, знали, что Земля круглая и что Землю можно найти, плывя на Запад, если брать начало с Европы.
- :Английский: |-
    Many sailors had made contact with the mysterious western realms, some driven by errant winds, others driven by reckless desires to discover and colonize.
  :Русский: |-
    Многие моряки имели контакт с мистическими сферами Запада, кого-то направляли странствующие ветры, других же безрассудное желание открытий и колонизации.
- :Английский: |-
    There were the Vikings, of course.
  :Русский: |-
    Были среди них и Викинги, конечно.
- :Английский: |-
    There was St.
  :Русский: |-
    Был Святой Брендан Ирландии, некоторые Кельтские мореплаватели и был загадочный Каталонский мистик, покорявший моря - Джон Раммон Ллюлли (John Ramon Llully).
- :Английский: |-
    Brendan of Ireland, various Celtic sailors, and there was the enigmatic Catalan sea-going mystic, John Ramon Llully.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    After 1492 the finest minds and most courageous visionaries of Europe began their series of fabled voyages.
  :Русский: |-
    Минуя 1942, лучшие умы и самые отважные визионеры Европы дали начало серии легендарных путешествий.
- :Английский: |-
    Balboa, Magellan, Cortes, Pizarro, de Soto, Champlain, La Salle.
  :Русский: |-
    Балбоа, Магеллан, Кортез, Пизарро, де Сото, Чамплайн, Ла Салле (Марокко).
- :Английский: |-
    These were bold adventurers probing into unknown and scary places, propelled by personal grail goals, greed, piety, power, curiosity, lust for the Fountain of Youth.
  :Русский: |-
    Это были "голые" приключения, постоянная разведка сулила неизведанными ранее и воистину страшными местами. И все это - ради жажды собственной наживы, власти, благочестия и похоти до Фонтана Молодости.
- :Английский: |-
    Each returning to add his notes and observations to construct the map of the New World.
  :Русский: |-
    Каждый, возвращаясь чтобы привнести свои очерки к наблюдениям и построить карту Нового Света.
-
- :Английский: |-
    And during the later centuries these heroic blazers were followed by millions, stacked in galleys, seeking New Life and New Freedom in the West.
  :Русский: |-
    И в течение следующих веков за этими героями следовали миллионы, в поисках Новой Жизни и Новой Свободы на Западе.

    The Second Age of Exploration 
  :Русский: |-
    ## Второе Тысячелетие Исследований
- :Английский: |-
    Throughout human history the great psychologists and the enduring yogic schools have claimed that the human being possesses, within, a vast world of simultaneous-unifying wisdom, a thought-universe which can be accessed by the skilled adept.
  :Русский: |-
    Со временем истории человека, великие психологи и йоги утверждали, что человек, в себе, имеет обширный мир бесконечно-единящей мудрости, Вселенную мысли, которая может быть познана умелым знатоком.
- :Английский: |-
    These great visionary practitioners developed effective techniques for activating different states of mind, using drugs plus meditative techniques.
  :Русский: |-
    Эти великие практики-визионеры развили эффективные техники для активации разных состояний сознания, используя вещества и техники медитации.
- :Английский: |-
    But they had no understanding that this universe of meaning within was actually the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    Эти великие практики-визионеры развили эффективные техники для активации разных состояний сознания, используя вещества и техники медитации.
-
- :Английский: |-
    Until recently there were no models to describe how the brain digitizes, stores, processes, and retrieves information.
  :Русский: |-
    До недавних пор, не было установлено никаких моделей того, как мозг оцифровывает, хранит, создает и извлекает информацию.
- :Английский: |-
    It was called, "the Mind-Body Problem."
  :Русский: |-
    Это называлось, "проблемой Мозга-и-Тела".
- :Английский: |-
    Remember?
  :Русский: |-
    Помните?
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the modern west, the first pioneers of the Second Age of Exploration, people like Aleister Crowley, George Gurdjieff, Tom Robbins, Aldous Huxley, Christopher Hyutt, Alan Watts, Baba Ram Dass knew how to use traditional oriental methods for "turning-on" the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    В современном Западе, первые пионеры Второго Тысячелетия Исследовааний, такие как Алистер Кроули, Георгий Гурджиев, Олдос Хаксли, Том Роббинс, Кристофер Хайатт, Аллан Уаттс (Alan Watts), Баба Рам Дасс, знали традиционные способы "включить" мозг.
- :Английский: |-
    But they too had no understanding how the brain operated.
  :Русский: |-
    Но и они не обладали знанием о том, как сам мозг оперирует.
- :Английский: |-
    Indeed, how would it be possible for those living in the mechanical-gearsand- wheels civilization of 1960 to understand how the electronic circuitry of the brain works?
  :Русский: |-
    И в самом деле, откуда взяться шансам на то, что вырощеный в механико-роботических условиях этой цивилизации человек, будет знать о работе электронных схем мозга.
- :Английский: |-
    Think of the crude neurotransmitters of the 1960s � LSD, psilocybin, ketamine � as the leaky galleons of the first heroic generation of brain pilots.
  :Русский: |-
    Подумайте о "грубых" нейротрансмиттерах 60-ых - ЛСД, псилоцибин, кетамин - как о первоисточниках, породивших первое поколение психонавтов.
-
- :Английский: |-
    In these last three decades neurology and psychopharmacology have developed precise methods of activating various altered states with neurotransmitters.
  :Русский: |-
    За последние тридцать лет неврология и психофармокология разработали точные достаточно методы активации разных состояний сознания при помощи нейротрансмитерров.
- :Английский: |-
    The metaphor of brain geography has become the standard paradigm.
  :Русский: |-
    Метафора "географии мозга" стала привычной парадигмой.
- :Английский: |-
    We speak of left-brain/right-brain.
  :Русский: |-
    Мы говорим о левом/правом полушарии.
- :Английский: |-
    New-brain/old-brain.
  :Русский: |-
    Новом/старом мозге.
- :Английский: |-
    NLP adepts talk about temporal location, age regression, activating early memories.
  :Русский: |-
    Нейро-лингвистическое программирование (НЛП) и его адепты говорят о временном расположении, возрастной регрессии, активации прошлых воспоминаний.
- :Английский: |-
    Researchers are discovering how neurotransmitters switch messages off and on at the synapse.
  :Русский: |-
    Ученые пытаются выяснить, как нейротрансмитеры включают и выключают передачу сообщения в месте синапса.

- :Английский: |-
    *But Nothing Happens until the Models Are Constructed*
  :Русский: |-
    *Но ничего не происходит до тех пор, пока не сконструированы модели.*
- :Английский: |-
    In the sixteenth century various national and private groups sponsored exploration of the New Worlds.
  :Русский: |-
    В 16-ом веке некоторые частные и национальные учреждения спонсировали исследования Новых Миров.
- :Английский: |-
    They began collecting navigational and cartographic data and attempted to establish colonies.
  :Русский: |-
    Они начали сбор навигационной и картографической информации и пробовали продвинуть идею колонизации.
- :Английский: |-
    The Hudson Bay Company, for example.
  :Русский: |-
    Например, Компания Хадсон Бэй (The Hudson Bay Company).
- :Английский: |-
    The East India Company.
  :Русский: |-
    Ист-Индийская Компания (The East India Company).
-
- :Английский: |-
    So it was with the early exploration of the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    Так было с ранними исследованиями…
- :Английский: |-
    A brave little band in Menlo Park led by swashbuckling sailors like A1 Hubbard and Willie Harmon launched hundreds of planned LSD trips, in this case hoping for mental-health profits.
  :Русский: |-
    Отважная маленькая команда в Менло парке, под управлением удалых моряков, как Ол Хаббард (Al Hubbard) и Уилли Хармон запустили сотни запланированных ЛСД-трипов, в конкретном случае, надеясь на улучшения в области психического здоровья.
- :Английский: |-
    In Canada, Humphrey Osmond's lusty lads did the same hoping for a Nobel Prize.
  :Русский: |-
    В Канаде, крепкие парни Хампри Осмонда сделали то же самое, надеясь на Нобелевскую премию.
- :Английский: |-
    In the film-colony of Hollywood brave neuronauts like Oscar Janiger M.D. charted the course of Cary Grant and hundreds of brain-settlers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Around San Francisco, Ken Kesey and Stewart Brand served as controlstations for their orgiastic, dionysian Acid Test Flights.
  :Русский: |-
    Вокруг Сан Франциско, Кен Кизи и Стьюарт Брэнд послужили "контрольными станциями" по продаже билетов на оргиастичный "Кислотный Тест".

    Venerable old Harvard University became base for the most extensive neurological missions.
  :Русский: |-
    Старый почтенный Гарвард стал базой для самых обширных неврологических миссий.
- :Английский: |-
    Many of these groups developed languages and models to chart and record psychedelic trips.
  :Русский: |-
    Многие из подобных групп сконструировали модели и языки для планирования и записи психоделических опытов.
- :Английский: |-
    The Harvard group alone published over a dozen manuals and guidebooks, based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the Tao te Ching, etc.
  :Русский: |-
    Гарвардская группа, сама, выпустила в свет больше дюжины мануалов, за основание которых были взяты "Тибетская Книга Мёртвых", "Дао дэ Цзин" и др.
-
- :Английский: |-
    At the same time (1960-1970) over six million landlubbers paddled off from the little private islands of their own minds into the uncharted tropical-arctic realms of the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    В то же время (1960-70) более чем 6 миллионов сухопутных обывателей начали грести со своих частных островков сознания в глубинные, неизведанные, тропически-арктические сферы мозга.
- :Английский: |-
    Each was blown by the winds of set-and-setting to a different continent and returned with a singular report.
  :Русский: |-
    Каждый был снесен ветрами сэта и сэттинга сего нового континента и возвратился с собственным рассказом.
-
- :Английский: |-
    All of this feverish activity produced a massive confusion.
  :Русский: |-
    Вся эта лихорадка спровоцировала серьезную путаницу.
- :Английский: |-
    Something incredibly profound was happening here, but no one knew exactly what.
  :Русский: |-
    Происходило что-то по-настоящему глубокое, но никто точно не понимал что.
- :Английский: |-
    People were blasting off to bizarre and glorious places, but no one knew where or why.
  :Русский: |-
    Люди уносились в невероятные и дивные места, но никто не понимал куда и почему.
- :Английский: |-
    The "dangers" of brain-voyaging have been hysterically discussed, but not well understood.
  :Русский: |-
    "Опасности" мозговых путешествий были подвергнуты истерическим обсуждениям, но не были хорошо поняты.
- :Английский: |-
    The perils are not physical.
  :Русский: |-
    Опасности не были физическими.
- :Английский: |-
    Going to Vietnam in the late 1960s was about ten thousand times more hazardous to your physical health than dropping acid.
  :Русский: |-
    Поехать во Вьетнам в конце 60-ых было куда более опасно для вашего физического здоровья, чем закинуться кислотой.
- :Английский: |-
    The suicide rate, which plummeted during the hope-fiend 1960s, predictably rocketed in the sober 1980s.
  :Русский: |-
    Статистика совершенных самоубийств, которая потерпела спад в 60-ых, радикально поднялась в трезвых 80-ых.
- :Английский: |-
    However.
  :Русский: |-
    Тем не менее, все "опасности" примитивных 60-ых имели психологический характер.
- :Английский: |-
    The "dangers" of brain exploration in the early, primitive days of the 1960s were psychological.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There were no languages, no models, no explanatory paradigms.
  :Русский: |-
    Не было ни языков, ни моделей, ни объясняющих парадигм.
- :Английский: |-
    At that time the trip involved "terra incognita," mystery, enigma, paradox, perplexity, riddle.
  :Русский: |-
    В то время трип включал в себя "терру инкогниту", мистику, тайну, парадокс,запутанность, загадку.
- :Английский: |-
    The so-called "acid burnout" referred to an acute state of bewilderment, radiation overexposure, short-term memory loss (often complicated by the more insidious "longterm memory gain").
  :Русский: |-
    Так называемое "кислотное перегорание" было ассоциировано с состоянием дикости, радиационной передержки, потерей кратковременной памяти (зачастую усложненное более хитроумной "долговременной памятью").
- :Английский: |-
    Fortunately this state is always temporary in people with one shred of sanity and common-sense.
  :Русский: |-
    К счастью, такое состояние лишь временно у людей с наличием хотя бы одной извилины и долей здравого смысла.
- :Английский: |-
    The manuals and guides we produced, however scholarly and Hindu-solemn, were woefully inadequate, based as they were on yogic traditions and mystic philosophies that antedated even the industrial age.
  :Русский: |-
    Мануалы и руководства, которые мы создали, сколь бы научными и индуистски направленными ни были, были к сожалению неадекватными, базировались на йогических традициях и мистических философиях, которые обгоняли даже индустриальную эпоху.
- :Английский: |-
    During this period of noisy investigation, of high hope and well-publicized confusion there was one man who stood aloof and regally alone.
  :Русский: |-
    Во время этих громких исследований, высоких надежд и широко публицированных смятений, был один человек, который стоял в стороне и в гордом одиночестве.
- :Английский: |-
    I speak of one scientist who never abandoned the empirical tradition for flashy mystical visions.
  :Русский: |-
    Я говорю об ученом, который никогда не отрицал эмпирического подхода, даже когда дело доходило до сильнейших мистических переживаний.

    Is it too gushy to call this the Principia Psychologica of the Cybernetic Age?
  :Русский: |-
    Будет ли слишком лестным, назвать этот труд Принципией Психологии Кибернетического Века?
- :Английский: |-
    Few have read i t So what You don't have to pore over the dusty book The title says it all.

    Помимо всего, мы восхищались, насколько озарённым было его нутро. "The Scientist", и впрямь - метафизическая биография.

    Hence it is a continuation of his previous books for those who have read them.
  :Русский: |-
    Следовательно, эта книга — продолжение его предыдущих трудов, является одновременно и автобиографией.
- :Английский: |-
    Hence it is also autobiographical.

- :Английский: |-
    The forms in this work were chosen to free the author for maximum clarity of expression of deeply felt, deeply experienced events.
  :Русский: |-
    Формы описания были выбраны таким образом, чтобы дать волю автору передать глубину своих переживаний в как можно более чистой форме.
- :Английский: |-
    Some of these events involved interactions with powers in the human organizations in which he served.
  :Русский: |-
    Некоторые из этих событий включают взаимодействие с властями гуманитарных организаций, членом которых он был.
- :Английский: |-
    The forms were developed from his necessity to communicate these events without endangering himself and his friends within the human organizations.
  :Русский: |-
    Формы описания были разработаны исходя из его необходимости изложить эти события не подвергая опасности себя и его друзей из гуманитарных организаций.
-
- :Английский: |-
    He felt, and feels, that the forms used allow expression of a point of view as objectively neutral as is possible to him.
  :Русский: |-
    Он чувствовал, что формы, использованные в описаниях, позволяют выдержать настолько объективный характер повествования, насколько было для него возможно.

    We are all human.
  :Русский: |-
    Мы все люди.
- :Английский: |-
    No known nonhuman intelligence yet reads what we write or hears what we say.
  :Русский: |-
    Нет такого нечеловеческого разума, известного нам, который читает что мы пишем и слышит, что говорим.
- :Английский: |-
    So we are humancentered� communicating only with one another.
  :Русский: |-
    Значит мы поддерживаем коммуникацию лишь друг с другом.
- :Английский: |-
    We judge from human standards.
  :Русский: |-
    Мы судим по человеческим стандартам.
- :Английский: |-
    We live for human goals.
  :Русский: |-
    Мы живём ради человеческих целей.
-
- :Английский: |-
    We ignore other possible intelligences and communication with them.
  :Русский: |-
    Мы игнорируем другие потенциально существующие разумы и коммуникацию с ними.
- :Английский: |-
    In a sense, we all unknowingly suffer from a dis-ease which I call "interspecies deprivation."
  :Русский: |-
    В какой-то степени, мы страдаем заболеванием, которое я называю "межвидовая депривация".
- :Английский: |-
    We have no known chroniclers of human events outside our own species, no known judges using nonhuman criteria.
  :Русский: |-
    Нам неведомы летописцы не из рода человеческого, неведомы судьи, руководствующиеся нечеловеческими критериями.
- :Английский: |-
    We have no history of the planet other than our own.
  :Русский: |-
    У нас нет истории планеты, отличной от нашей.
- :Английский: |-
    Our economics, our laws, our politics, our sciences, our literature, our organizations are all anthropocentric.
  :Русский: |-
    Наша экономика, законы, политика, наука, литература, организации — антропоцентрические.
- :Английский: |-
    Our bodies, in their anthropomorphic form, limit us to human activities, to human communication.
  :Русский: |-
    Наши тела, в своей антропоморфной форме, ограничивают нас лишь на человеческие действия и человеческую коммуникацию.
-
- :Английский: |-
    Among the forms of expression used in this work, the author refers to not-human "Beings" whom, in his own deep self, he has experienced at various times.
  :Русский: |-
    Среди выразительных форм, использованных в данной работе, автор ссылается на не-человеческих "Существ", присутствие которых в глубине его собственного Я он испытал в разных случаях.
- :Английский: |-
    From the human-centered viewpoint of us all, we tend to label such events and their transcription into written form as fiction.
  :Русский: |-
    С нашей антропоцентрической точки зрения, мы склоняемся к нарицанию подобных событий и их описаний словом фикция.
- :Английский: |-
    In this sense, this book is fiction, an imaginary creation of the author.
  :Русский: |-
    В этом смысле, эта книга — фикция, нечто, порожденное воображением автора.
-
- :Английский: |-
    Looked at from a less human-centered point of view, all human communication is fiction.
  :Русский: |-
    Смотря на это с менее антропоцентрической точки зрения, вся человеческая коммуникация — фикция.
- :Английский: |-
    We fill in our vast domains of ignorance of the real universe with imaginative explanations.
  :Русский: |-
    Мы заполняем невероятные по масштабам сферы нашего невежества выдуманными объяснениями.
- :Английский: |-
    Even our best science was and is created by humans in isolation on 2.9 percent of the dry part of the surface of a small planet in a small solar system in an isolated galaxy.
  :Русский: |-
    Даже наши лучшие прорывы науки были созданы человеком-в-изоляции, на территории 2.9% сухой части маленькой планеты, в крошечной Солнечной системе, в изолированной галактике.
-
- :Английский: |-
    There are other intelligences�nonhuman�here on the surface of our planet and far more ancient than we are.
  :Русский: |-
    На поверхности этой планеты есть и другие разумы — нечеловеческие, и намного более древние, чем мы.
- :Английский: |-
    They are always wet, and we are dry.
  :Русский: |-
    Они всегда мокрые, а мы сухие.
- :Английский: |-
    We kill them for human-centered reasons.
  :Русский: |-
    Мы убиваем их исходя из антропоцентрических причин.
- :Английский: |-
    Separated from their seaborne communications, we pursue our dis-eased course, deprived of their counsel.
  :Русский: |-
    Отделенные от их подводных коммуникаций, мы придерживаемся избранного нами зараженного пути, не имея малейшего понятия об их юрисдикции.
- :Английский: |-
    We classify them as economic resources to be exploited for human industry.
  :Русский: |-
    Мы классифицируем их как экономические ресурсы для эксплуатирования человеческой индустрией.
- :Английский: |-
    We categorize them as animals, as if we are something or someone else than animals.
  :Русский: |-
    Мы категоризируем их как животных, как будто сами мы что-то или кто-то иные, чем животные.
-
- :Английский: |-
    Hence, if the author is correct, our current consensus view of whales and dolphins is a contrived fiction, an imagined explanation generated by a sick species�the human one.
  :Русский: |-
    Таким образом, если автор прав, наше представление о ситуации с китами и дельфинами — лишь выдуманная фикция, выдуманное объяснение, сгенерированное больным умом — человеческим.
- :Английский: |-
    If the author is incorrect, he is creating a new fiction to be added to all the other works of fiction and is suffering from the overactive imagination to which most humans are heir.
  :Русский: |-
    Если автор не прав, то он лишь добавляет ещё одну фикцию в этот мир фикций и страдает от гиперактивного воображения, которое унаследовано большинством людей.

    No matter how it turns out in our future, dear reader, please read and enjoy.
  :Русский: |-
    Неважно, прав автор или нет, дорогой читатель, пожалуйста, просто читай и наслаждайся.
- :Английский: |-
    Ifyou feel safer assuming this book isfiction, do so.
  :Русский: |-
    Если тебе будет проще считать эту книгу фикцией, считай её таковой.
- :Английский: |-
    If you sense something deeper than fiction, assume it to be so and perhaps you will learn, in a larger perspective, of your own humanness.

    # Prologue 
  :Русский: |-
    Пролог
- :Английский: |-
    The Starmaker stirred, awoke from his/her Rest in the Void.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Consciousness-without-an-object turned upon Itself, saw Itself turning upon Itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Feeding back through Itself, it created the Zeroth Distinction, an Infinite Series of Itselves alternating with the Void, of the Void protuberating a sequence of Beings^ Void, Beings2, Void, Beings3, Void, et sequens.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Out of the Void came HYPERSPACE, the first Sign of the Starmaker awakening Creation.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the largest sequence, the Starmaker instantaneously (ten to the minus twenty-seventh power seconds) created HYPERSPACE, Consciousness-without-an-object, the First Distinction of the Starmaker.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    HYPERSPACE (Consciousness-without-an-object) is endowed by the Starmaker with his power of Creativity.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    HYPERSPACE turned upon Itself simultaneously in two different directions, creating two expanding and contracting vortices within Itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Starmaker created the Second Distinction: two HYPERSPACE vortices, adjacent, dancing each with the other.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was naught else as yet.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Starmaker, his HYPERSPACE, his two vortices, and the Void were the only Cosmic Contents.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The vortices separated, rejoined, danced together, separated again, rejoined, in infinite sequence.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As they joined each other, orgiastic energy built up, closer and closer, higher and higher the positive, loving energy appeared, the Third Distinction: Love.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At the peak of the approach of the two vortices they merged in orgasm.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Out of their orgasmic meeting spun two new fresh vortices, making now four vortices in HYPERSPACE.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The two new ones danced, trading places with the first two, creating new pairs, dyadic creation continuing in HYPERSPACE.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Each pair of vortices was minute (less than ten to the minus thirty-third power centimeters), the beginning of a trace of certainties, of probabilities in a deep sea of INDETERMINACY.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Each pair danced with other pairs as the generative sequence in HYPERSPACE formed the first Group of pairs.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Fourth Distinction: the Group.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Out of thefirst Group of pairs of vortices in HYPERSPACE came the Origin of space-time, ordinary space, ordinary time.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Out of the Origin came the first particle of ordinary matter�a closed group of pairs of dancing vortices, saying " i AM."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This group whirled one way, found its mirrored image whirling the other way created samely�the second particle of matter: antimatter.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The two groups merged, unwinding their vortices, became the first radiant energy traveling as two photons�two fields fleeing each other, establishing Light in the new space-time.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    An infinite sequence of Groups in HYPERSPACE followed, generating a primordial mass of matter at the Origin.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As vortical pairs poured out of HYPERSPACE at the Origin, the mass of matter became packed into a Great Bomb, centered at the Origin in space-time.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Over a few billions of years of ordinary time the Bomb grew.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly (at a density of ten to the eighteenth power grams per cubic centimeter) it blew up in the first of the series of Big Bangs.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Matter spread, creating more space-time from HYPERSPACE as it spread; it whirled, vorticizing, creating nebulae, spiraling galaxies, stars, planets, all whirling, partaking of the primordial vortices' natures.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The Starmaker watched his Creation, his new expanding creature made of condensed vortices from HYPERSPACE, from Consciousness-without-an-object.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He watched as his creature developed Itself, its consciousness of Itself in each and every part.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Communication links, arbitrary signals, appeared, connecting part to part, whole to part, part to whole�consciousness connections between conscious part and conscious whole.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As each small part awoke to its existence in the whole, it assumed it was the center, as if the Origin: that ancient memory built into each vortex pair.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each particle, each atom, each molecule, each organism, each planet, each star, each galaxy thought itself unique, as if the first one of its class.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    With aging each such Being realized its nonuniqueness, its universality, its creaturenature, its place in the new Universe.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each Being realized its real origin in HYPERSPACE, its constituent vortex dyads.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Each Being existed in two places simultaneously�in ordinary space-time and in a Connection to HYPERSPACE, a Connection to Consciousness-without-an-object, a Connection to the Starmaker.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As knowledge of its Self developed, each Being was endowed with a double consciousness, a consciousness of Itself and a consciousness of its Connection.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As each Being developed further it remembered the real Origin, the real Connection, and its Universal connected nature.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each Being recognized a portion of its evolution from the past and into the future.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each Being recognized Itself as a portion of smaller wholes and those as a portion of larger wholes.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Within a limited framework of space, space-time, and HYPERSPACE, the Starmaker allowed each to make certain limited choices.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The HYPERSPACE portion of each Being remained connected to the whole consciously.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each Being could adjust the amount of Connection to the HYPERSPACE whole and was permitted to forget this for periods of time in which it was involved with the evolution of its own Self.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At the end of the evolution of its own Self in a particular form, the Being was to return to HYPERSPACE, rejoin the whole, rejoin Consciousness-without-an-object.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    No matter whether the Being was a galaxy, a planet, a star, 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    a solar system, an organism, no matter its unique Self, eventually 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    it became nothing in terms of ordinary matter and space-time as 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    it rejoined Consciousness-without-an-object in HYPERSPACE.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    was then permitted to reassemble its individual Self and move back into ordinary space-time in any Form that it chose, wherever there was room among the other manifested Beings.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Some Beings attaining advanced States of Being were permitted continued conscious memories through all stages from out of HYPERSPACE through a current Form and back into HYPERSPACE and out of HYPERSPACE again.
  :Русский: |-

    # A Being Makes a Choice 
  :Русский: |-
    Существо делает выбор
- :Английский: |-
    Among the billions of Beings created after the first Big Bang from the primordial Bomb, one took many Forms traveling through the creation of the Starmaker.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This Being's portion of Consciousness-without-an-object was segregated from the primordial Consciousness-without-an-object and given the status of an individual consciousness.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In its transition from Form to Form, its knowledge was stored in the Network.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Its contained memories were only of how to make transitions and retain memories of its Individuality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In each Form it was permitted to develop new memories based upon its experience.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the infinite sequence of Forms permitted to its choice, at one juncture it chose a particular galaxy, a particular star, a particular solar system, a particular planet, a particular Form on that planet.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    It rested in HYPERSPACE, contemplating from HYPERSPACE the planet and the organisms on that planet, and chose its new Form.
  :Русский: |-
    
-Оно отдыхало в ГИПЕРПРОСТРАНСТВЕ
- :Английский: |-
    On this particular planet were many, many different kinds of organisms, too numerous to count.
  :Русский: |-
    На этой конкретной планете было множество видов организмов, огромное неисчислимое множество.
- :Английский: |-
    The Form it chose was that of a human.
  :Русский: |-
    
-Оно выбрало человеческую форму.
- :Английский: |-
    It studied its chosen Form, the necessities of conception, of rest in utero, its birth to a particular pair of parents.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It chose one of two alternate Forms of human, the male or the female.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    It chose to be male.
  :Русский: |-
    Оно выбрало быть мужчиной.
- :Английский: |-
    From this vantage point it directed a male sperm into a female ovum.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It chose the genetic code that would regulate its Form in the future as it grew.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It chose the unique genetic code that it would have from those available among the sperms and eggs of the parents.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Once it determined the chain down which it would develop and up which it would go, it moved into a particular sperm and a particular egg and directed the penetration of the sperm into the egg.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As the sperm entered the egg and the nuclear material of each fused into a single cell, there was a vast explosion within the consciousness of this Being.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly it condensed into an individual and proceeded to regulate, to control development� the mitosis and meiosis�of its final Form.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It then grew and rested from the task of choice contained within the uterus, allowing the automatic formulation of its new Form by the genetic code.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    # Birth 
  :Русский: |-
    Рождение
- :Английский: |-
    The resting Being in the uterus was aware now of its Form: its new Form developed as an embryo and then as a fetus.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly its new home was limited, limiting.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It felt squeezed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It felt compressed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It felt it was dying.
  :Русский: |-
    Оно чувствовало что умирает.
- :Английский: |-
    The deep redness, purpleness, of its existence was suddenly turned into an unpleasant, devastating constriction.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Its local universe became an upheaval, a moving, thrashing, undulating upheaval of its Being.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It split off from the local catastrophe, moved out briefly, and watched from outside.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It saw clearly the outside of the Mother, saw the Mother struggling to give birth to it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It saw the beginnings of the opening of the birth canal.
  :Русский: |-
    Оно видело начало раскрытия канала рождения.
- :Английский: |-
    It saw a head begin to appear.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For several hours the head was stuck in the birth canal.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Then the Being understood the compression, the devastation, the cutting-off of its Rest.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It waited and watched.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly the head broke through and the body came out.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Being then saw that it was a complete human male baby.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It moved back into the body of the baby and activated the respiratory system, gasping the new air into the new lungs as they expanded.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    It was inundated with new sensations never before experienced.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Explosive amounts of light, of shaking, of shivering, of cold upon a skin which for the first time was felt as an envelope, a boundary, to itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It heard for the first time its own cries, which at first seemed to be coming from outside.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    But slowly, surely, it began to realize that by its own voluntary efforts it was producing these cries.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    There was a long delay in the cold, in the too-bright lights, in the severance from the warm place.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly its cries were stifled as its mouth was pushed against a soft, warm surface.
  :Русский: |-
    Внезапно его крик оборвался так как рот прильнул к мягкой теплой поверхности.
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly it started to suck in a warm fluid which restored to it the warm resting-place once again.
  :Русский: |-
    Внезапно оно начало всасывать теплую жидкость, которая вновь переносила его в умиротворяющее место.
- :Английский: |-
    It felt the warm milk enter into its own Being and become at one with Itself.
  :Русский: |-
    Оно ощущало как молоко проникает в само Существо и становится единым целым с ним.
-
- :Английский: |-
    # Suckling 
  :Русский: |-
    # Suckling
- :Английский: |-
    Once filled with milk, it went once more into HYPERSPACE and watched.
  :Русский: |-
    Насытившись молоком, оно ещё раз вышло в ГИПЕРПРОСТРАНСТВО и смотрело.
-
- :Английский: |-
    From HYPERSPACE it saw a human baby suckling at its Mother's breast, now asleep.
  :Русский: |-
    Из ГИПЕРПРОСТРАНСТВА оно увидело человеческого ребенка, сосущего грудь своей Матери, теперь спящим.
- :Английский: |-
    It saw the Mother lift the fragile little body and place it in a basket, covering it up to avoid the cold of that particular climate.
  :Русский: |-
    Оно увидело Мать, поднимающую маленькое хрупкое тело и укладывающую в кроватку, укрывая его, чтобы уберечь от холода того конкретного климата.
-
- :Английский: |-
    It explored the house in which the parents lived and found a small boy playing in another room.
  :Русский: |-
    Оно изучило дом, в котором жили родители и нашло маленького мальчика, играющего в другой комнате.
- :Английский: |-
    In the small boy it saw resentment that the Mother had been taken from him by the new baby.
  :Русский: |-
    В маленьком мальчике оно увидело негодование, то, что Мать была отнята от него этим новым ребенком.
- :Английский: |-
    The small boy did not remember his own birth, his own suckling.
  :Русский: |-
    Маленький мальчик не помнил своего рождения, своего кормления.
- :Английский: |-
    All he remembered was his weaning, his severance from the Mother at the birth of the new child.
  :Русский: |-
    Все, что он помнил - было отнятием от груди, его отрыв от Матери с рождением нового ребенка
- :Английский: |-
    His resentment clouded his consciousness and filled him with anger.
  :Русский: |-
    Его негодование затмило его сознание и наполнило его злостью.
-
- :Английский: |-
    The new Being watched as the young boy decided to express his resentment toward the new baby.
  :Русский: |-
    Новое Существо смотрело, как мальчик решил проявить свое негодование к новорожденному ребенку.
- :Английский: |-

    A long sequence of suckling, of sleep, of terror, of sleep, of suckling went on interminably as the baby grew, as the Being got more firmly attached to the body of the baby.
  :Русский: |-
    Длительная последовательность кормления, сна, ужаса, сна, кормления, шла бесконечно, по ходу взросления, по мере того, как Сущность все больше становилась привязанной к телу ребенка

    The Being took fewer and fewer trips out of the body of the baby into HYPERSPACE, maintaining a tenuous connection with HYPERSPACE.
  :Русский: |-
    Сущность совершала все меньше путешествий вне тела, в ГИПЕРПРОСТРАНСТВО, сохраняя незначительную связь с ГИПЕРПРОСТРАНСТВОМ.

    The Being began to listen to the sounds around it.

    It found that it could mimic these noises in a primitive, longlasting way with its own mouth; that it could vibrate its own Being with the sounds, not all crying, not all gurglings, the beginnings of vowels, the beginnings of consonants.
  :Русский: |-
    Оно обнаружило, что может создавать такие же звуки в примитивной, продолговатой форме, своим ртом; что оно может вибрировать свою собственную Сущность звуками, не плачущими, не всхлипывающими, но началом гласных, началом согласных.

    As the scientist calmed down, the analyst spoke.

    There was a bad boy today who won all my agates and my steelies and left me with only clay marbles that won't even roll straight.

    If you put sodium in water it melts and travels around on the surface.

    He gave me some and I tried it in the laundry tub.
  :Русский: |-

    I put a little bit in.

    It formed a ball, melted, and traveled around on the surface of the water, making a hissing noise.

    When I put some starch in the water and a bigger piece of sodium, it got so hot that it burned with a yellow flame and exploded all over the ceiling.

    Mr. Dickman promised me a piece of potassium.

    Uncle John told me today how the cannon works.

    The gas coming from the calcium carbide, called acetylene, mixes with air and it explodes and causes the bang when the spark ignites it.

    Dick gets a new horse, a bronco from Montana which he breaks in the corTal using his lariat and the long leather whip which I had helped him to weave.
  :Русский: |-

    The bronc becomes his horse and he rides it with his friend, Alice, who lives down the road.

    One day after riding with Alice, he is late for dinner.

    All the boys have the same accent she has.

    Besides, she plays many games, keeping me away from her boyfriend.

    That summer I went to work for the first time.

    I was fifteen years old and asked Father if I could get a job with the Northwest Airways, of which he was now president.

    I went to the manager, Colonel Britton, to apply for a job.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He asked me what I could do and I said, " I am an amateur radio operator and would like to work in the radio department."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During that summer I met many of the pilots.
  :Русский: |-

    The head of the radio department put me to work pulling all the wiring on the Hamilton airplanes, putting in shielded wiring to prevent the noise of the engines from getting into the radios.

    It was a very hot summer, and it was extremely hot work.

    The airplanes would get to 110 degrees Fahrenheit inside at the airport where I was working.
  :Русский: |-

    I was paid fifty dollars a month.
  :Русский: |-

    I spent three months on the job and then went back to school totally disillusioned about what it was like to earn money in that particular way.

    I learned that those who knew more, who had learned more

    in college, were the ones who got the good jobs and the higher pay.
  :Русский: |-

    I vowed to continue my education and make myself fit for doing the kinds of things that a young scientist should learn to do.

    I would not be caught in the ignorance which 1 found among most of the workers in the airlines.

    Father's bank and the idea of working in banks appalled me.

    I learned to play golf and discovered what shallow conversations took place on golf courses.

    At the St.

    Paul Academy I took my first science courses and realized that I knew most of the physics and chemistry in those introductory courses.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    So I spent my time in class devising new experiments, new demonstrations of things which I wanted to see and about which I had only read.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    My teacher, Mr. Varney, had a vacuum pump, a plate, and a bell jar and introduced me to the phenomena of gas discharges, electrical discharges in gases at low pressures.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We made glow tubes and I began to learn about the various colors of light emitted by gases excited by electricity at low pressure.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I learned what makes neon signs emit light.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the pendulum experiments, I set up a photo cell and an electric counter to count the number of times the pendulum swung back and forth each minute.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I learned the laws of the pendulum with this experimental setup.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I learned the law connecting the length of the pendulum with its vibration period, very rapidly.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I stayed after school hours and did further experiments under Mr. Varney's gentle direction and encouragement.
  :Русский: |-

    I took the required course in athletics.
  :Русский: |-

    I played football.
  :Русский: |-

    I was a guard on the first string.
  :Русский: |-

    We won the city championship that year.

    My name appeared in the newspapers as the key person in one of the championship games.
  :Русский: |-

    I was exhilarated briefly and then realized that today's headlines wrap tomorrow's garbage.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I became disillusioned with athletics and decided to do something else.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Mr. Herbert Tibbetts, the master of English and Latin, encouraged my interest in philosophy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He referred ine to Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I studied it and studied it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At first it made no sense, then gradually I realized that with words and ideas one can prove anything, as long as there is no reference to experiments in the external world.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I saw that the only hope for science was experimental science, in which one tested one's ideas by experiment and experience.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Kant could prove the thesis and the antithesis in parallel columns.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    My illusion that by pure reason one could arrive at an adequate picture of the universe was shattered.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The absolutes that I had learned in the Catholic Church were destroyed finally and irrevocably.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    My search for reality was initiated.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Mr. Tibbetts asked me to write something on reality for the school paper.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I spent weeks on this and struggled with many ideas way beyond my grasp, but I finally wrote an article contrasting the activities of the brain and the activities of the mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I did not know it at the time, but this article turned out to be a plan for my future scientific career.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    A slight injury to a knee in a football game allowed me to withdraw from sports gracefully.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Mr. Tibbetts then encouraged three of us to do a documentary movie on school life.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We spent the year shooting with my mother's 16-mm motion picture camera everything that happened on campus, including football games, hazing in the two school clubs, meals in the cafeteria, classes, and faculty meetings.
  :Русский: |-

    We edited our own film after accumulating six thousand feet of black and white footage.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We cut the film to an hour-long feature.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The headmaster called us in before the film was to be shown to the parents and the student body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He said, " I want a private showing of this film before they see it."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We objected and said there were only three days left and that if he had any objections to the film we wouldn't have time to edit it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He demanded that we show the film to him, so we did, quaking the while for fear he wouldn't approve of our work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We had scenes in which older boys were fighting with younger ones, some of them getting hurt during these fights.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We had also shown some paddling of pledges to the clubs.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He objected to these scenes, and the oldest of us, Louis Goodman, gave a very articulate, political plea for the film.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Mr. Briggs was so impressed with this plea that he did not insist on censoring the film and allowed us to show it the way it was.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As a consequence of the film, the board of trustees had a meeting and abolished the two clubs and their hazing and insisted that there be better relationships between the faculty and the students to prevent the kind of student conflicts which we had shown in the film.

    Paul Academy, I became imbued with an ambition to become a research scientist.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I took the college boards and was accepted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Mr. Varney had a long talk with me about M.I.T.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He said, "There is a scientific school on the West Coast in California, the California Institute of Technology, which has abetter science course than M.I.T.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I would like you to apply there also.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    By the way, they do not accept the college boards; they have their own entrance examinations."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    I was immediately intrigued and challenged by the fact that they did not accept college boards.
  :Русский: |-

    Mr. Varney arranged for the examinations to be sent from Cal Tech to the St.

    Meanwhile, I'd fallen in love with a girl from the East Coast, from Boston.

    Her name was Amelia.

    Amelia was a gentle, cultured, artistic, withdrawn girl.

    To me she was beautiful, delicate, and at the same time athletically competent.

    Paul, she was staying with an aunt who chaperoned her very carefully.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She had been accepted at Vassar College, so I went east when she left for the summer and visited her on Cape Cod.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I met her family and then had my first fight with her over what college I would go to.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She refused to promise to date me if I came to M.I.T.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I went back to Minnesota, disappointed and heartbroken.
  :Русский: |-

    When I arrived Mother said, "You have a letter from Cal Tech."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    I opened the letter and it said, "We are pleased to inform you that your grades on our entrance examinations were high enough that we wish to offer you a scholarship."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    I had an immediate fierce joy.
  :Русский: |-

    This would settle the case of Amelia, and I would be independent of Father for the first time.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    I delighted in showing Father the letter.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He immediately disagreed and said that 1 should go to M.I.T., that it was a far more important school than this unknown Cal Tech out on the West Coast.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I argued and fought with him and left in a rage.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had said that he would not pay my fare to California but that he would pay for my tuition, room and board, and transportation to M.I.T.
  :Русский: |-

    In my disappointment and grief, I got on my horse and rode off through the woods trying to think it through.

    The next day Mother and Father asked to talk to me at lunch.

    Mother said, "D o you really want to go to California to school?"

    I said, "Of course.
  :Русский: |-

    I have never been to California and I want to go there.

    I don't want to live in Boston or Cambridge.

    I hear that Cal Tech is in a quiet little town called Pasadena."
  :Русский: |-

    Father said, "You know, your mother and I took our honeymoon in Pasadena at the Huntington Hotel."
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    "Well, all I know is that I want to go there to college.
  :Русский: |-

    I have a scholarship there and I feel that I'm making my own way independently of you."
  :Русский: |-

    Mother then said, "We've talked it over and we'll leave the decision up to you.

    Your father strongly recommends that you go to M.I.T.

    Thus was the decision made.

    I do not have much feeling about John's past life today.

    I seem to be riding somewhere above him, watching him."

    When John last spoke to me he was reviewing his life andfinished the review through prep school as he was about to go to college.

    Do you want that review to continue?"
  :Русский: |-

    John: "Yes.

    I will instruct my agent to give you a continuation of his integration of his past life.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Because of my presence and his knowledge of my presence, he will be speaking through me.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I, as well as you, will be observing the material that he generates from my point of view, not his own.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I will speak through him, recounting the story in the third person rather than in the first person."
  :Русский: |-

    Robert: "You mean that you are aware of all of his past life?"
  :Русский: |-

    John: "Yes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I have been with him during his whole life and have complete access to all his memories, some of which he does not remember.

- :Английский: |-
    I believe you use the terms 'repression' and 'suppression' of memories for this process.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As John speaks in the third person, I will be inserting portions of the true story insofar as my agent can take it at the present time.
  :Русский: |-

    As you and I both know, it will be necessary for John to do many such reviews with my help and with your help.

    Go ahead and speak for John."
  :Русский: |-

    John: "I am worried about allowing that Being to speak for me."

    Robert: "Let the Being speak through you."
  :Русский: |-

    In the following material, John on the couch spoke as if he were a Being from somewhere else, recounting the story of his life from prep school through Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the fall of 1933 John's parents drove him to the railroad station.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was literally leaving home for the first time.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was eighteen years old and facing a future in which he would only reluctantly return to his home in Minnesota.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His home had furnished the nurturance needed for his new life.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The train traveled through Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada, and arrived in Pasadena, California, three days later.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During those three days he gradually developed a sense of his aloneness, of a future in which his family and his old friends would be less and less important to him inside his own being, even though they would remain important to him in terms of his survival on the planet.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He arrived at the California Institute of Technology as one of one hundred entering freshmen.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He registered and was assigned a room in a student house known as Blacker.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The first few days were spent in an orientation course given by the YMCA in the San Gabriel Mountains.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At this gathering of freshmen, he learned that his fellow students were like himself, somewhat eccentric with regard to the rest of humanity.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When he talked with another freshman, he began to see that he had come home, that each of them knew as much as he about science and were dedicated to learning more within the current scientific knowledge.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He became acquainted with the Cal Tech motto, "The truth shall make you free."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His belief in this motto was already formed, as it was among his fellow students.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He learned that most of them looked down on the football team, which had managed to lose every game for the last five years.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He heard that the athletic program was a requirement, that so-called P.E., for physical education, was considered a joke among the students.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The faculty and the administration expected the students in each of the four student houses and the off-campus students in the Throop Club to establish rivalries.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They had their own football games, tennis games, and chess competitions to develop a group feeling in each house.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The freshmen in each house were segregated into their own 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "alley."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The choice of rooms was dictated by seniority.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The seniors and the juniors got the best rooms, the sophomores the least desirable, and the freshmen were given arbitrary assignments.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The students in each house ate together in their own dining room.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There were no undergraduate or graduate women students at that time.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each house had the austerity and the dedication of a monastery.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    A member of the faculty lived in each house.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In Blacker House the resident was Dr. Harvey Eagleson, a member of the humanities department who taught English literature.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During John's freshman year, Doc Eagleson became a powerful teacher for him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Doc insisted that his students attend teas in his room, and John became acquainted with Freud, with art, with all those things that were not taught at Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Doc treated the symptoms of homesickness, loneliness, separation from family with wit and understanding.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He considered the students his own family.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had never married and had written a novel about his one love, a woman who had died in an automobile accident.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His apartment was lined with a perfect collection of Japanese prints by Hiroshige.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Doc attracted those students who were interested in art, philosophy, literature, and writing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He encouraged their literary endeavors.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For John he was an inspiration to continue the writing he had begun at the St.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Paul Academy.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In his opening course in English literature, Doc started out with the following statement: "I n 1859 God died.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The pile of dirt upon his grave has been increased continuously since that time."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    To John this statement was a shocker.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was still in the throes of his earlier beliefs in regard to the Catholic God.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Doc's lecture went on to explain that in the year 1859 there were two important events leading to the demise of the old religious beliefs: the publication of Charles Darwin's Origin of Species and the birth of Sigmund Freud.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Thus Doc represented the first person with whom the young John could speak about beliefs, about swinging from Catholicism over to a belief in science and its conclusions about the origins of Man. Under Doc's tutelage John bought the works of Freud and studied them in his spare time.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He read Darwin's books and gradually saw the emerging picture of reality as dictated by the current consensus signs.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He personally went through the battles that were started in the nineteenth century and revised his own beliefs to bring them up to date in the twentieth century.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John found that he had been assigned to the A Section.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There were twenty students in A Section, all of whom had scholarships to Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This section had special teachers, faculty who were particularly interested in bright students and who pushed them in their courses.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that the discipline he had acquired at the St.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Paul Academy stood him in good stead, that the study habits, the long hours over books were expected of him in A Section.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found his peers among the other freshmen in his class.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He made friends with the few graduate students resident in Blacker House.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He had come to Cal Tech dedicated to becoming a physicist.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As he met others who wanted to go into physics, he realized that this was an incredibly demanding discipline.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Physics required advanced mathematics and a supreme dedication.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Approximately half the student body were to become scientists, the other half engineers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that the engineering students were the ones who played football and were more outgoing, organizing group activities.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He shrank from them and devoted his time to the science students.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He had many doubts that he could survive the rigors of training at Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He expressed these doubts only to Doc Eagleson.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    His roommate was a tense, dedicated mathematics student by the name of Jack Mason from San Diego.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As it turned out during the freshman year, Jack was in way over his head.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Unable to survive, he left to go to Stanford University.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Among the undergraduate body there was a great deal of snobbery in regard to other schools.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Cal Tech was at the top of the heap and the students were an elite.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This not-so-subtle snobbery among the undergraduates was a mimicry of the more subtle snobbery of the faculty.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Cal Tech accepted only the best: the young undergraduate did not perceive that "the best," as defined by Cal Tech, was based on a very narrow set of criteria within the academic disciplines.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In later years John was to realize that the Cal Tech graduates were an effective, operational group of men.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Associated with him in Blacker House was a future head of the Atomic Energy Commission.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Among the graduate students was a future president of Stanford University.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Among his faculty was the future head of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    One of his teachers was to become the organizer of the yet to be established National Security Council.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The faculty also included several Nobel prize winners.
  :Русский: |-

    Dr. Robert A.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Millikan was the head of Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During John's first year he and his wife held dinners for the freshmen.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Dr. Millikan's wife, Greta, was a gracious lady in the old tradition.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John was to work with their son Glenn during World War II.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During the frantic push of courses in the freshman year John immersed himself in physics, in mathematics, in chemistry for thirty-six hours a week.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In addition he took humanities courses: history, English, economics.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These were a relief from the pressing business of science.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He took the English courses from Professor MacMinn, who allowed him to write essays about what he was reading in Freud's works.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    MacMinn also encouraged imaginative productions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In 1934 John wrote one essay as an account of World War I from the viewpoint of an extraterrestrial traveling in an orbiting vehicle about the earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, published a year or so earlier, was read assiduously by the young undergraduate.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At the end of his freshman year he found that he had passed sufficiently well so that his scholarship was granted again for the sophomore year.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As the year ended Doc Eagleson asked John to come to talk to him in his rooms.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Doc said, " I have an important message for you.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You have made a basic mistake at Cal Tech and I wish to straighten that out with you.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I do not want your future prejudiced by a continuation of that mistake."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John immediately became fearful and imagined all sorts of possibilities as to what the mistake was.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Doc continued, "Your mistake was in accepting the scholarship that was given to you.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At the faculty meeting about scholarships, the fact that your father is well-off and has sufficient money to send you to Cal Tech was brought up.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You should have accepted the honor of the scholarship without accepting the money."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John felt a sinking feeling in his belly and thought to himself, They do not understand the real situation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I was attempting to become free of Father.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Why wasn't I told this?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    My letter said that I was receiving a scholarship to pay for my board, room, and tuition, with no other explanations.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It didn't mention any conditions for accepting the honorarium.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I feel the faculty is being unjust."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Doc: "Unjust or not, that is how the faculty thinks.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    That is the way the human reality operates."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "The Cal Tech motto is, 'The truth shall make you free.' You mean to say the truth is not communicated in full here at Cal Tech?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Doc: "Truth is relative.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Scientific truth is one thing; human truth is another thing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The human truth here is that your reputation with the faculty has been damaged by your accepting the scholarship when your father could pay."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Doc, you know about my family, that I accepted the money to be independent of my father.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I am incredibly disappointed that Cal Tech does not back me up in this and that they tell me in such a sneaky way."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Doc: "Calm down, John.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This isn't the end of the world.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If you want to, you can accept the money for next year.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I am merely telling you that if you do the faculty will be prejudiced.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their judgments about you in the future may spoil some of your chances to do other things."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "What the hell is really going on, Doc?"
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Doc: "It has come to the attention of the faculty that your father is wealthy enough to become an Associate of Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Do you know about the Associates program?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "No."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Doc: "Tuition does not support the undergraduate program.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Cal Tech needs additional money, so Dr. Millikan has worked out the Associates program.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Associates are wealthy men who contribute ten thousand dollars or more.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They are told the aims of Cal Tech and have special days when they tour the campus.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Those in charge of the program have found that your father is in a position to contribute money to Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They cannot approach him if you are a scholarship student, whether your funds are donated by the Associates program or not."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Look, Doc, one of my major triumphs in coming to Cal Tech was that I could be free of my father's influence.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If he becomes an Associate here, my fellow students may think that somehow or other my father is buying my way through Cal Tech."
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Doc: "Well, it's high time you learned the realities.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There's not much more I can say about this, except the faculty counts on many sources of income to support their teaching and researchdonations to Cal Tech, consultancy fees with industry, grants from corporations or government agencies who want certain kinds of research done.

    That summer John returned to Minnesota, rode horseback, lived with his family, thought about what Doc had said, and finally had a conference with his father in which he explained what Doc had said to him and asked his father for support.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His father and mother talked it over and informed him that they would support him during his education, that they would set aside the money for this in a trust fund.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    John wrote a letter to the Scholarship Committee asking that the money for his scholarship be put back in the fund and distributed to more needy students.
  :Русский: |-

    Toward the end of the summer, his father informed him that he had been invited to become an Associate of Cal Tech and that he was contributing a thousand dollars a year for ten years to the Associate funds.

    That summer in Minnesota John was made even more aware that he was an eccentric.
  :Русский: |-

    His friends from the St.
  :Русский: |-

    Paul Academy had gone to the East Coast to Ivy League colleges.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When he met them that summer he realized that they were further and further away from his particular universe of experience.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their stories of college life were so alien to his experience at Cal Tech that he was unable to understand how anyone could function in the ways in which they functioned.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Most of their stories were about football games, about parties, about whom they met, whom they had talked to, and the gossip of the East Coast.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His high school friends had gone to Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Vassar, Holvoke, Bryn Mawr, Smith.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their dates, parties, trips to New York to see the latest show on Broadway or to the Yale-Harvard game were the content of their conversations.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    John felt out of the picture, separate and quite lonely.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The parties he attended were boring, the girls beautiful and unavailable.
  :Русский: |-

    He felt like an outsider looking at a scene in which he could not participate.

    Amelia had returned to Minnesota that summer.
  :Русский: |-

    She was remote and did not want to date him.
  :Русский: |-

    He dated another girl from his high school days and found her shallow and unsympathetic to his discussions of philosophy, science, and Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found one other Cal Tech undergraduate in Stillwater, Minnesota, and spent his time with him.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He began to look upon his hometown of St.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Paul as a dead end, as a place where there was no scientific curiosity, no curiosity about the world, about the universe.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His conflicts with his family sharpened, and he decided that he would never again come back to Minnesota if he could avoid it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His remaining bonds with his family, with his traditional life, were gradually dissolving.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He increasingly resented the necessary financial dependence on his father and mother.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He spent most of his time in the radio station talking to radio hams around the world.
  :Русский: |-

    Everywhere he went in Minnesota, he was faced with questions about his father, rather than about the work he wished to discuss.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    In the fall of 1934 he returned to Pasadena, to Cal Tech, and took up his life as a student once again.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During that year he was exposed for the first time to biology.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As a major in science rather than engineering, he was assigned the elementary course in biology under Thomas Hunt Morgan.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Professor Morgan taught all science students this course.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It shaped John's future as no previous course was able to do.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the opening lecture Professor Morgan showed a slide of an embryo in the uterus.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He said, "This is the embryo of a pig.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    No, this is an embryo of a monkey.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Oh, I'm sorry, I've mixed up all the slides.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This is an embryo of a human.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Oh, well, at this stage it doesn't make any difference; they all look the same."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    To John this was a shock.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    That all mammals went through similar stages of development, including Man, was an entirely new concept to him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The embryological evidence for the origins of Man as one among many mammals was an exciting idea to the young student.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As the course progressed he decided that he had found the area of science in which he wished to leam more.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the subsequent years at Cal Tech, he shifted to biology and found the most interesting area for him was the study of the origins, the development, the functions, and the structure of the central nervous system, the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    There were three students specializing in biology as undergraduates.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each of these students was taught by ten times as many faculty as there were students.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each undergraduate did a research problem in one of the biological sciences.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each student was expected to do genetics research on the fruit fly, which had given Professor Morgan the opportunity to map the genes along the chromosomes of the fruit fly.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He received the Nobel prize for this work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John took courses in genetics, in plant physiology, in vertebrate zoology, in biochemistry, in neurophysiology, in embryology, in mammalian anatomy.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He became intrigued with single-celled animals, the protozoans.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Under the microscope he watched algae move around rapidly, absorbing light through their chlorophyll and whipping their busy way through the water with their single flagellum or their cilia.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He watched the development of plants from seeds; he watched the development of sea organisms from their fertilized eggs.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He dissected cats, frogs, fish.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He studied the brains of the smaller organisms and the brain of the cat.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He saw demonstrations of the electrical activity of the brains and nervous systems of crayfish, of cats.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He studied the literature of neurophysiology and became intrigued with the electrical activity of the brain and the possibilities inherent in the various techniques used.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In his first undergraduate faculty seminar John discussed a paper by Edgar Adrian, "The Spread of Electrical Activity in the Cerebral Cortex."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This paper excited his interest to the point where John decided to devote himself totally to the study of the brain and its electrical activity.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He conceived of a method of portraying, of visualizing, the electrical activity of the cerebral cortex in a television-like manner to see the waves spreading rapidly over the surface of the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Many years later he was able to carry out this idea, build the apparatus, and see these waves as they had never before been seen.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    During his junior and senior years, he was asked to join the Anaximandrian Society in the biology department at Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    This society was sponsored by Dr. Henry Borsook, the professor of biochemistry.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the society each of the students was asked to research a paper on certain subjects within biology and medicine.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John chose the history of man's ideas about the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He researched the literature from the time of Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen, up through the nineteenth century.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Researching this paper expanded his interest in the physiology of the brain and the development of ideas about the connection between the brain and the mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In various conversations with Professor Borsook, it finally became apparent to him that he would dedicate the rest of his life to research on the mind and brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Dr. Borsook said, "The kind of knowledge that you need to pursue research on the mind and the brain is available only in medical schools.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You will find that unless you take an M.D. degree you will not be able to do the kinds of things you wish to do in your scientific endeavors.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I suggest very strongly that you take the M.D. degree rather than a Ph.D."
  :Русский: |-

    John took this advice and applied to several medical schools.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    As the extraterrestrial Being finished speaking, John took over his body once again and lay on the couch silently contemplating what had happened during this hour.

    Robert: "To whom am I speaking now?"

  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Somehow I am me again."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "While the Being was speaking, were you aware of what was going on?"
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Yes, but every so often I was panicking, afraid that I would not be able to take control of this body again."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "Have you ever hadan experience like that before?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "I seem to remember experiencing this kind of 'dissociation' when I was very sick as a child.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There were long periods when, lying in bed, unable to go out and play with my brothers, I felt as if the Being were present, speaking to me and at the same time through me.

    Robert: "So you've experienced this Being before under conditions in which your physical organism was depleted by disease, fever, or anesthetics?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Yes, but today wasn't like that.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There has been no disease, no injury, no anesthesia, no drugs."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "So you are becoming aware that you tend to split into human being and extraterrestrial Being?"
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Yes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I now immediately think of all sorts of psychiatric diagnoses of such states.
  :Русский: |-

    I think of hypnotic regression and splitting.

    Robert: "So your internal reality rejects psychiatric and psychoanalytic explanations for what has been happening to you here today."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Yes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There seems to be something inadequate in these ready clinical explanations.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    But on the other hand, my running away from those explanations may be merely another attempt of my very ingenious unconscious to explain away by other means, by more spectacular means, what is really going on inside me."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "How would you explain what has been going on here today?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Well, all I can say is that this seems beyond anything that is explainable by my present knowledge of science, psychoanalysis, and psychiatry.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Somehow, something is going on that surpasses our present framework of thinking and explaining."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "I am not here to argue explanatory theorems.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I am here to point out to you what is going on inside you insofar as I am aware, and can become aware, of those processes, of you as you really are, not as some clinical diagnostic tools would label you.

    The following day John came into Robert's office and lay down on the couch with an energetic thump.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    John: "I have been thinking about what happened here yesterday during the hour, with the Being taking over and recounting my history as if from a third-person viewpoint.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The reality of that experience is still with me.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If all this is happening just inside my head and there is no real, mysterious Being from some extraterrestrial place, then I was using this as a means to escape involvement in the feelings of my past life.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In that case I was simulating the Being to avoid penetrating more deeply into my own unconscious.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I was pretending to be a historian, giving the history of somebody else, not me.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I find with this method of speaking in the third person that I can penetrate some things I can't penetrate when I speak in the first person.
  :Русский: |-

    I find the Being a convenient construct which allows me to sit outside and observe what is said as if I did not own it myself.

    "Today I want to continue in that mode of discourse.
  :Русский: |-

    This will allow me to check out various events of my past life from a more objective standpoint."
  :Русский: |-

    Robert: "So you feel safer speaking as if your past life belonged to somebody else?"

    John: "Yes.

    Today I will continue the review of my life as if I am a historian, writing it in a book.

    John: "Not as real as yesterday.

    He, she, or it is somehow not in this room but is more remote, somewhere else, as if listening to me speaking here to you."

    For the first two years of his education at Cal Tech, John had lived a monkish existence, dating infrequently and working very hard at his education.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the beginning of his junior year, at the age of twenty, he met Mary.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He dated her several times and in his naive, monkish way fell in love with her.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His Catholic upbringing was still determining how he acted with respect to women.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He still believed that he should not have sexual intercourse before marriage.
  :Русский: |-

    He decided that when he was twenty-one and legally free of parental direction he would marry Mary.
  :Русский: |-

    His work at Cal Tech began to deteriorate.
  :Русский: |-

    He did not get enough sleep and he did not apply himself to his work the way he had the previous two years.
  :Русский: |-

    He became exhausted.
  :Русский: |-

    He contemplated leaving Cal Tech and going to some easier college or university.

    In February of his junior year he went to see his parents and told them that he couldn't continue.

    They sent him to a neurologist who advised him to drop out of school and find a physical job, forgetting the intellectual work for a period of some months.

    With the help of his father, he obtained a job in a lumber camp in Oregon.

    He was assigned to a bunkhouse in which there was an epileptic.

    Another member of the survey crew got up and went over to the epileptic, who was having an attack, and inserted a spoon in his mouth to prevent him from biting his tongue.

    For a while John was frightened by this episode and moved into the nearby town.

  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In pursuing a survey line through a swamp, he was cutting brush with an ax and badly cut his foot.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He thought at first that he had cut the head off the small dog which attended the survey crew because there was no pain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When he realized what had happened, he stopped the blood gushing from his foot by lying down in the swamp, raising his foot in the air, and holding on to the artery.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He shouted for help and the survey crew took him to the hospital.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The surgeon was sewing up his foot.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He said, "You must know something of anatomy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    That ax went into your foot in such a way as to hit nothing important and yet go in very deeply."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John, in a light manner, said, "I've been studying Gray's Anatomy."
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Surgeon: "Are you planning to go to medical school?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Yes, when I graduate from Cal Tech, I am going on to medical school."
  :Русский: |-

    Surgeon: "You'll have to stay here in the hospital until this heals.
  :Русский: |-

    I will be giving you typhoid vaccine to raise your temperature to take care of possible infection in your foot.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Here you will learn a lot that will stand you in good stead in medical school."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Under the influence of the typhoid vaccine his fever went up to 103 for a period of three days.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His foot slowly healed.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He was in a ward with automobile-accident cases, with millaccident cases.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He could not sleep because of the noise, the moans, and the cries of the other patients at night.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His resolve to go to medical school and to be of direct help to such people increased.
  :Русский: |-

    When he recovered he left Oregon, went back to Minnesota, and made plans for his marriage.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    His father and mother insisted on a Catholic church wedding and obtained the services of the priest who had been influential in John's earlier education, Francis Thornton.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Catholic church chosen was in Pasadena.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The wedding party flew out from Minnesota to join Mary's family and friends in Pasadena.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It was a formal wedding with the men dressed in morning coats.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The solemn ritual of the Catholic Church dominated the scene.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Mary, a non-Catholic, was given Catholic instruction and agreed to bring their children up in the Catholic Church.
  :Русский: |-

    After the honeymoon John and Mary found a small apartment near Cal Tech and began their married life as students.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John was the only married undergraduate at Cal Tech and felt separated from the student body by his marriage.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Mary returned to art school and John continued as a junior at Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was able to resume his intense work.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During that year Mary found she was pregnant.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Late in her pregnancy she fell and broke her spine.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She was in very bad pain during the last months of the pregnancy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It was decided that she would return to Minnesota to be taken care of by John's parents.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The baby was bom while John was taking final examinations for his junior year.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Meanwhile, Mary's pain increased in her lower back and legs.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    During the summer of his junior year, John returned to Minnesota and, on his father's recommendation, went to the Mayo Clinic and talked to Dr. Will Mayo about what medical school he should attend.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John waited for Dr. Mayo in his outer office.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had been up late the night before and fell asleep.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Dr. Will came out of his inner office, tapped the young man on the shoulder, and said, 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "Do you want to see me or do you want to continue sleeping in my outer office?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The embarrassed young man got up and apologized.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the subsequent conversation Dr. Will said, "There is only one place for you to go to medical school.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The basic course that you will have to master is human anatomy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    No matter what you do in the future in medicine or in medical research, that is the course that you must absorb.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There is only one place in the United States where that course is taught adequately.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    That is at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, New Hampshire.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Dr. Frederick Lord teaches a course that is not duplicated anywhere else.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Go to Dartmouth and start your medical school."
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    By coincidence John's younger brother, David, was an undergraduate at Dartmouth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Dr. Will's advice and the presence of his brother made him decide to go to Dartmouth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He sent in his application and was finally accepted under rather unique conditions.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Dartmouth rarely accepted medical students from outside of Dartmouth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The undergraduate students took their first year of medical school as their senior year in the undergraduate college.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John sent an application to be admitted to the medical school.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Dr. Will sent a letter to the dean, Dr. Bowler, recommending the young student.
  :Русский: |-

    John had learned Doc Eagleson's lesson well.
  :Русский: |-

    This time he was not loath to use influence to move on the path he had chosen.

    In John's senior year at Cal Tech, his father drove his car off a bridge and dropped a hundred feet to the ground below.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John went to Minnesota and sat by his father's bed for three weeks while he was in coma in an oxygen tent.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    One morning his father came out of coma, looked at John, and immediately said, "You are not going to Dartmouth Medical School, you are going to Harvard."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "I am going to Dartmouth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Welcome back.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I am glad that you are out of coma."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John spent another week and returned to Cal Tech to finish his senior year, take the final examinations, and graduate.
  :Русский: |-

    His wife and child were at his graduation.

    Mary and John decided to drive to Dartmouth with all their possessions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During John's first year of medical school, Mary's pain was such that it was decided she must have an operation on her lower back.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She went through a spinal fusion and was in a cast from her pelvis to her shoulders for the next three months.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At Dartmouth John began a whole new series of studies which seemed very far from the pure science of Cal Tech.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found, as Dr. Will had predicted, that Dr. Lord's course in anatomy was extremely thorough.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He spent several hundred hours dissecting human cadavers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He thought bacteriology fascinating.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The histological sections of human tissues to him were evolutionary works of art. 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John took up skiing in earnest and worked out a method of determining the position of the center of gravity of the skier in various body movements.
  :Русский: |-

    He worked out a method of recording the sounds of the human heart in parallel with the electrocardiogram.

    Among the twenty-two medical students in his class, there was only one other who did research, Fred Worden.
  :Русский: |-

    In their two years at Dartmouth together, they laid the foundation for a lifelong friendship.
  :Русский: |-

    During these two years Dr. Rolf Syvertsen became the dean of the medical school and advised the young medical student to go to the University of Pennsylvania Medical School rather than the Harvard Medical School, which the young man preferred.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Years later he appreciated this advice and realized that the decision was a good one, that he was exposed to certain influences at the University of Pennsylvania that he would not have experienced at Harvard.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Somehow, coincidence kept him away from Harvard, first as an undergraduate and then as a medical student.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At Dartmouth he firmed up his resolve to continue his medical education and to go into medical research on the brain and the mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His courses in neuroanatomy and neurology convinced him of what he had to learn in order to work on the brain versus mind dichotomy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In his introduction to psychiatry at Dartmouth, he discovered the limitations of this field of medicine.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His earlier work in neurophysiology at Cal Tech guided him in the choice of directions he could take.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Dartmouth experience reinforced his choice and began to give him the background he would need in the future for his scientific research.

    After their first year at Dartmouth, Mary decided to go to Hawaii and take their young son with her.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    While she was away, John returned to Cal Tech and did his first scientific research under the direction of Dr. Borsook.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In this research he analyzed his own urine and blood and followed the excretion of single products of metabolism in a protein-free diet.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He also took test doses of amino acids and followed the excretion of the product.
  :Русский: |-

    In Hawaii, Mary took a course in painting, learning about the use of pigments that would last.
  :Русский: |-

    During his second year at medical school, in the midst of his clinical studies at Dartmouth, John did research on the side.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He worked out a method of determining the melting points of drugs in very small amounts on a small heated wire under a microscope.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    While John was doing research evenings, he met a surgeon who was attempting to do research and carry on clinical work simultaneously.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He advised John not to split himself between the two but to decide which way he was going to go: into therapeutic medicine or into medical research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At this point John decided to take the way of medical research, continuing as a medical scientist rather than a therapist.
  :Русский: |-

    John met Professor H.
  :Русский: |-

    C.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Bazett as a junior medical student at the University of Pennsylvania.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He told Professor Bazett that he wanted to do research and was given a room in the medical school to carry out this work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Bazett wanted a means of recording blood pressure which was continuous and which could be used on the tilt-table and in flying aircraft.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was English and England was involved in World War II.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Bazett was already doing military high-altitude research.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John looked at the machine that had been devised, a photoelectric method of recording blood pressure, and decided that it would not hold up under the stressful conditions which were required for the work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He thought of a new method and proposed it to Bazett, and Bazett furnished the funds to develop the method.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the next year John worked out the method and tried it on himself and on Bazett in the main artery of the arm.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The method worked and Bazett took the machine with him to Toronto to use with the Canadian Royal Air Force research unit.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Within a year John was encouraged to publish his first solo scientific paper entitled The Electrical Capacitance Diaphragm Manometer, describing this method of recording blood pressure.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During this research John met Britton Chance, who was in charge of the department of biophysics.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Chance advised him about various difficulties that he was having with electronic circuitry and helped him to solve these problems.
  :Русский: |-

    Upon graduation from medical school in 1942, John was asked to join the department of biophysics by Detlev Bronk, who had heard of his work through Britton Chance.
  :Русский: |-

    For the next eleven years, he remained on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, working under Bronk and then under Chance.

    During all this time his marriage continued on its rocky road.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The young man was spending most of his time on his student work and then in scientific research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He struggled to partition his life more equably but did not succeed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was driven to do the research and hence did not spend much time with his family.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After the war he had his first affair with another woman.
  :Русский: |-

    His parents heard of this affair through Mary and called him back to Minnesota.
  :Русский: |-

    His father, extremely angry, told him that he would disinherit him if he did not live up to his marriage vows.
  :Русский: |-

    Upon his return to Philadelphia, John went through an extended period of fear and paranoia, separated from his family and from his scientific colleagues.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He appealed to a fellow graduate from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, who suggested very strongly that he go into psychoanalysis.

    John started a search for possible analysts and finally found one, Dr. Robert Waelder.
  :Русский: |-

    Robert: "What are your feelings now about the technique that you are using of recounting your history as if you are a historian?"
  :Русский: |-

    John: "I t seems to me that it is a very useful technique to speak in the third person.

    Material comes up which wouldn't if I spoke in the first person.
  :Русский: |-

    And yet I have doubts about it.

    I do not seem to be so totally immersed in the memories as if I were speaking in the first person.
  :Русский: |-

    There is not the engagement of my feelings with what I am saying that there was earlier in the analysis when I was speaking in the first person."

  :Русский: |-

    There is no extraterrestrial Being and no historian.

    My 'Calvinistic conscience,' as you call it, says that I am crazy to be talking like an extraterrestrial Being or like a historian.

    The third person is somehow or other unreal."
  :Русский: |-

    Robert: "So your feeling of insult, your feeling that I insulted you with my opening remarks, is a projection?"

    John: "Yes, it is merely me, split in regard to my feelings and my conscience.

    Anyway, all of this seems very trivial and I would like to get on to something more important.

    I haven't shared this secret mission with anyone else, and I had my doubts about sharing it with you until that negative feeling came out and I could look at it."

    This will be so that you can understand the basis for that mission as objectively as I can give it to you.

    At Dartmouth and later at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, the young scientist continued to learn the dogma taught about the human brain and mind in American medical schools.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His courses in psychiatry, in neuroanatomy, in neurosurgery, and in neurology showed him the consensus medical reality, the simulation of the medical men themselves, of the human race in general.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He took these years as preparation in what is known and what is simulated about himself and his fellow human beings.
  :Русский: |-

    The human consensus reality took over his mind, his body, his brain, his social relations.
  :Русский: |-

    At the University of Pennsylvania from 1940 to 1945 he did military high-altitude research under the Committee on Medical Research of the Office of Scientific Research and Development on contracts to the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.
  :Русский: |-

    He began to understand that Man's knowledge of his own mind and brain was at a primitive stage of development and had very little influence over the power politics, the economic structure of the country, the media, or the new United Nations.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to see that his mission might be premature in the human society on this planet.
  :Русский: |-

    His desire to study the brain and the mind of Man was put in abeyance by the war.

    After graduation from medical school in 1942, he did his war work in the Johnson Foundation under Detlev Bronk.
  :Русский: |-

    The day the war ended Professor Bronk came into John's laboratory.
  :Русский: |-

    Det: "John, the war work isfinished.
  :Русский: |-

    It is time to start thinking in terms of new research, not war-oriented."

    Det was looking out of the window across a low building belonging to the medical school.
  :Русский: |-

    He said, "See that building there?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I would like to build another story on top, connected to this building.
  :Русский: |-

    It will cost approximately a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
  :Русский: |-

    I suggest that we approach your father to donate money for that building.

    If you can do this, then you will have a secure laboratory space for your own work under my direction."

    John: "What sort of research are you thinking of?"
  :Русский: |-

    Det: "I would like you to be on my team investigating single neurons.

    I would like to continue the work that I stopped during the war."
  :Русский: |-

    John: "Well, Det, now that the war is over, I would like to resume the kind of research I have visualized since 1937.1 want to work on portraying the activity of the intact, unanesthetized brain, over its surface and in its depth, using a television-like method."

    Det: "If you wish to do your own research, not on my team, you will have to raise the money yourself."

    John: "I don't know that I can raise the money, but if I can, may I maintain a position in the Johnson Foundation?"
  :Русский: |-

    Det, obviously disappointed: "If you do your own research independently of me, I can give you a position and a small salary, that is all."
  :Русский: |-

    John, feeling very anxious and quite upset: "OK, Det, I will try to raise the money for my own project."
  :Русский: |-

    John flew to Minnesota and talked to his father, who agreed to give him $10,000 for his own research from his foundation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He would transfer immediately $10,000 to the University of Pennsylvania for the purposes of brain research to be directed by John.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Using this money, and with the help of the personnel of the Johnson Foundation, John developed a twenty-five-channel television- like display device for the brain's activity on the surface of the cerebral cortex.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When the device was completed, waves of activity were seen moving across the cortex in rabbits, cats, and monkeys.

    He saw that the more skull was removed from an experimental animal, the longer it took the animal to recover from the operation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He recognized the essentially fragile nature of mammalian brains in the living state.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that anything one did to the skull and brain caused injury to the brain, sometimes only microscopic injury, at other times massive injury.

    He learned how to stimulate monkeys' brains in the unanesthetized state.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He learned that electrical currents improperly regulated eventually damaged brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He worked out a new electrical wave form that did not damage the brain of itself.
  :Русский: |-

    He mapped the movements of the body of the monkey through stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex.

    Meanwhile, he learned more about his own mind during his psychoanalysis.

    He discovered the social realities of being in scientific research.

- :Английский: |-
    His studies of his own mind and of the brains of animals and humans in the forties and the early fifties emphasized the current dichotomy of points of view about these two entities, the brain and the mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He conceived of a new technique to learn the intimate connections between the brain and its contained mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In his work in neurophysiology, he proposed the new technique in an obscure paper.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The scheme was somewhat as follows: If one could devise extremely small electrodes and wires to be inserted into a brain in numbers approaching ten thousand or more, one could pick up the electrical activity throughout the brain, record it, and at a later time feed it back into that brain through the same electrodes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    One would record the behavior of the animal during the initial record and then during the playback into the brain from the storage (on film or on magnetic tape) and compare the behavior in the two cases.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He hypothesized that if the behavior in the two cases was identical, the mind was contained in the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If the behavior was not identical, then there was at least the possibility that the mind was not contained in the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He visualized performing this experiment on himself so that he would have the additional source of information of his own inner experience.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "So you want to hook your brain up to a recording system and then play that recording back into your own brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Is this correct?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Yes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I visualize ten thousand, a hundred thousand, a million electrodes inserted through my skull into my own brain, hooked up to an adequate recording system.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The records would be made while I am actively doing something.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At a later time they would be played back through the same electrodes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I would then be able to tell if I went through the same actions, also recorded on motion picture film, that I had gone through originally.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I would also be able to see whether or not I had the same inner experience that I had during the original recording."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "Is this technique feasible at the present time?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "No, all the methods have to be worked out, including the insertion of the very fine electrodes and leads into the brain, with a minimum of injury."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "I can see that this raises a number of intriguing questions scientifically.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It would enable you to do experiments for the first time on the correlation between the consciousness of a person, his motivations, and the origins of these motivations within the structure of the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I appreciate the scientific and philosophical questions which such experiments could answer; however, here we must analyze your motivations for doing such experiments on yourself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    What are the dangers to you of such experiments?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "If I can make the leads and the electrodes small enough, and if I can make the necessary holes in the skull small enough, I can minimize the damage and maximize the safety of the procedures."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "You admit, then, that the present techniques are far too damaging to be used on yourself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Correct?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Yes, I will have to devote several years of research to methods which are less damaging than the ones that have been devised to date.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The plans call for much smaller leads, much smaller electrodes, much smaller holes in the skull than have currently been used.

    "I don't believe you appreciate the full scientific value of such work.

    A human subject so equipped could answer major philosophical questions which have bothered thinkers for centuries.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For the first time we would have a close correlation among the four areas: the electrical activity of the brain, the control of the electrical activity of the brain, the concurrent subjective states of the inside observer, and the external behavior, including the vocal output.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We would have an answer to the questions, Can electrical currents totally control the brain's activities?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Can electrical currents, put into the brain in suitable patterns, totally control the mind in that brain, the observer in that brain?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "I appreciate the scientific mission you have set yourself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You have said previously that you had the idea of doing this quite early in your career.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You reported that at age sixteen you wanted methods for correlating the activities of the brain and the mind.
  :Русский: |-

    You saw the possibilities of doing this in 1937 at age twentytwo.

    I appreciate your scientific dedication and I appreciate the importance of the questions which you are raising.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    However, I am a bit skeptical about your wish to do it on your own brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It seems to me that you have not fully evaluated your own motivations."
  :Русский: |-

    John: "My motivations are not self-damaging, suicidal, or masochistic, at least they are not consciously so."
  :Русский: |-

    Robert: "Well, as you have learned in this analysis, you do have strong components underlying your conscious motivation which could lead in the direction of self-damage.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It seems to me that you've picked the ultimate in self-damage by means of tens of thousands of brain electrodes."
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    John: "I t could be.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When I look upon myself as a human functioning in the human reality, which ignores totally brain structure, brain function, and the functions of the mind, the criteria of self-damage are obvious.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Yes, unconsciously maybe I do want to eliminate myself from the human competitive sphere.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    But I also detect a tendency to want to be a hero to other humans.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A hero takes risks.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A hero may end up damaging himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A hero can fail and become, in his own mind at least, a martyr."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Robert: "Your Catholic background postulates that you worship a martyr, Jesus Christ.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As we know from your history during your psychoanalysis, you had many wishes in your early life to become a priest, to become Christ, to hold yourself up as a human willing to sacrifice himself in the service of other humans.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Do you consider these realistic motivations for a mission?"
  :Русский: |-

    John: "Being a martyr publicly is seductive.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It is also dangerous and unrealistic.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Martyrs somehow have gone out of fashion.
  :Русский: |-

    Missionaries have gone out of fashion in an obvious public way.
  :Русский: |-

    Our methods today are more subtle.
  :Русский: |-

    One controls the educational system of young children and prejudices them into a human consensus reality that is desired for the control of large populations."
  :Русский: |-

    Robert: "As you know, I spend a good deal of my time on public affairs.
  :Русский: |-

    My avocation is political science.
  :Русский: |-

    I say these things which you already know in order to emphasize the essentially political and social aspects of your present mission.
  :Русский: |-

    This is an area which you have neglected in your education and in your research.
  :Русский: |-

    You have shown tendencies in your relations with your father, in relations with your scientific colleagues, to ignore political realities.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    What do you think the impact on your scientific colleagues would be if you revealed this wish to insert electrodes in your own brain and learn what the relation is between the mind and the brain by these rather damaging techniques?"
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    John: "Suddenly I feel that if I did this it would be highly seductive for other persons.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It would be intriguing to them.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It would set me up as 'the first man to find out about the relations between the brain and the mind.' I visualize myself as a hero, obtaining the Nobel prize.

    You wish to gain power, to become wellknown.
  :Русский: |-

    It seems to stem from a need for acceptance by your fellowman.

    It seems to arise from a desire to exhibit your own mind and your own brain publicly.
  :Русский: |-

    The secret nature of what you've been pursuing, of what you call your mission, seems to be some sort of a science-fiction script which you keep to yourself."

    Robert: "As you know, I do not worry about what you have made conscious.

    I only worry about what is yet in your unconscious.

    'Where id was, there shall ego be.' You know about the ego and its defenses as presented by myself and by Anna Freud.

    The boundary between your consciousness and the unconscious motivations is all that we can deal with here in your analysis.
  :Русский: |-

    In the future it will be necessary for you to work out how important this project is to you and to science in the human consensus reality.

    No one is ever completely free of unconscious motivations; however, it is possible to make more and more of those motivations conscious and to deal with them in the light of day."

    Then eventually I will use myself as the subject of the experiment.

    Until one is willing to undergo the experiments oneself, one must not perform them on other humans.

    By another technique one can pick up the electrical activity of the undamaged human brain in all its myriad parts.

    He came to the decision to move to Washington to work at the National Institutes of Health under Dr. Seymor Kety, who promised him space in two institutes, one devoted to the brain (the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness) and one to the mind (the National Institute of Mental Health).

    He saw that, through his old friend Kety, the possibility existed of pursuing his brain/mind program.

    He realized that he must keep one foot in those medical sciences devoted to the brain and the other in those devoted to the mind until he could see a secure way of combining the two aspects of research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the program he outlined to Robert, he realized that he must continue to pursue his researches in a dichotomous way, split (as was his society) between the two views of Man as possessor of a brain and of a mind, separated according to the limited techniques of that time.

    He decided to move to Bethesda and work out the means of safely doing what he wished to do, first upon animals and then upon himself.

    # Electrical Stimulation of the Brain 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Our goal has been to find an electric current waveform with which animals could be stimulated through implanted electrodes for several hours per day for several months without causing irreversible changes in threshold by the passage of current through the tissue.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Many waveforms, including 60-cps. sine-wave current can apparently be used safely for these limited schedules of stimulation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In our experience they cannot be used for the intensive, long-term schedule of chronic stimulation.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Electric current passed through the brain can cause at least two distinct types of injury: thermal and electrolytic.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The technical problem in chronic brain stimulation is to stay above the excitatory threshold and below the injury threshold in the neuronal system under consideration.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This result can be achieved most easily by the proper choice of waveforms and their time courses; and less easily by the choice of the range of repetition frequencies and train durations.

    # Control of the Brain and the Covert Intelligence Services 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In 1953, when John moved to the National Institutes of Health at Bethesda, Maryland, outside Washington, he took to Bethesda his new machine, which allowed the visualization of the activity of the brain in a television-like display.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had already demonstrated that the electrical activity on the surface of the brain moved in very particular ways across the cerebral cortex in rabbits, cats, and monkeys.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In his new laboratory he worked on another means of conducting this electrical activity from inside the brain to the outside apparatus.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At the University of Pennsylvania he had found an electrical wave form which could be used to stimulate the brain without injuring the stimulated nerve cells.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had demonstrated that the previous wave forms used in neurophysiology and in neurosurgery injured the neurons when unidirectional current passed through the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He developed a new electrical wave form to balance the current, first in one direction and then, after a brief interval, in the other.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Thus ions moving in the neurons would first be pushed one way and then quickly the other way, stimulating the neurons and leaving the ions in their former positions within the neurons.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This new wave form was called a balanced bidirectional pulse pair.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Microscopic studies of brains stimulated with this balanced pulse pair showed that there was no injury of the neuronal networks from this kind of stimulation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At NIH he continued this work.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In order not to injure the brain substance itself, six hundred and ten electrodes were placed on the cerebral cortex of one macaque monkey.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Being able to stimulate the brain through these electrodes without putting the monkey under anesthesia showed that the whole monkey brain was sensory and motor.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Every part of the cerebral cortex of the monkey gave responses in some muscle group in the periphery appropriate to that area of cortex.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John's extensive studies on the cerebral cortex were then amplified by stimulation of deeper brain structures.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Previous techniques of stimulating deeper structures involved removing fairly large areas of skull, placing the electrodes, and closing the holes with plastic.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His previous work with these techniques showed him that the brain was injured by its brief swelling through these holes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He decided that removal of the skull was also a damaging factor in the experiments.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He utilized a new technique he called the sleeve-guide technique.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    With this technique electrodes could be implanted in the brain without using anesthesia.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the process of implantation, there was no more pain to the animal than that of a needle prick in the scalp.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Short lengths of hypodermic needle tubing equal in length to the thickness of the skull were quickly pounded through the scalp into the skull.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These stainless steel guides furnished passageways for the insertion of electrodes into the brain to any desired distance and at any desired location from the cortex down to the bottom of the skull.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As many sleeve guides could be implanted as were desired.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Because of the small size of the sleeve guides, the scalp quickly recovered from the small hole made in it, and the sleeve guide remained imbedded in the bone for months to years.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At any time he desired the investigator could palpate the scalp and find the location of each of the sleeve guides.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Once one was found he inserted a needle through the scalp into the sleeve guide, down through the bone, and penetrated the dura.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After withdrawing the needle the investigator placed a small, sharp electrode in the track made by the needle and pressed the electrode (at the end of a long steel tube with a small diameter) through the scalp, through the skull, through the dura, and down into the substance of the brain itself to any desired depth.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    It was found that monkeys subjected to this procedure remained in perfectly good health, with no infection and no detectable aftereffects of the operations.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Since the brain itself has no pain fibers, insertion of the electrode deeper into the brain was not discernible by the monkey.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Using these electrodes and the safe, "balanced-pair" wave form, systems were found in several monkeys' brains which when stimulated caused pain, fear, anxiety, and anger.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These systems were found to exist mainly along the midplane of the brain, deep, near the bottom of the skull.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Surrounding these were matching systems, which caused pleasure, sexual arousal, and highly positive motivations on the part of the monkey.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Those systems which caused pain, fear, anxiety, and anger were called "negatively reinforcing" systems or, in the shorthand of the laboratory, "negative systems."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Those which caused pleasure and positive motivations were called "positively reinforcing" or, in the shorthand, "positive systems."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As the electrode was pushed into the brain one millimeter at a time and each site stimulated in turn, a technique was worked out to decide which site gave positive effects and which gave negative effects.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Electronic apparatus was arranged which would turn on or turn off an electrical stimulator.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The monkey was given two radio frequency switches, one that would turn the stimulation on and one that would turn it off. When the electrode was in a positive region, it was found that the monkey would quickly learn to touch the "on " switch to turn a short pulse-train on in those sites.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In negative spots within the brain, when the investigator turned the stimulus on, the monkey quickly learned to stop it with the "off" switch.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The results in both the positive and negative systems were reproducible within the same monkey and between monkeys.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    By extensive mapping, involving as many as six hundred sites within a given monkey brain, the positive and negative systems were thoroughly worked out, the locations determined satisfactorily, and the relations between the sites in the neuroanatomy of the brain described in detail.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The pain systems were mapped, the sexual systems were mapped.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    It was found that in male monkeys there were separate systems for erection, for ejaculation, and for orgasm.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    With an electrode in the separate orgasm system, the monkey would stimulate this region and go through a total orgasm without erection and without ejaculation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Given the apparatus by which he could stimulate himself once every three minutes for twenty-four hours a day, the monkey stimulated the site and had orgasms every three minutes for sixteen hours and then slept eight hours and started again the next day.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the negative systems it was found that, if the apparatus was set up to automatically stimulate the monkey once every three minutes for twenty-four hours a day, it would shut off the stimulus each time during the twenty-four hours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If this stimulus was continued for too many hours, the monkey became sicker and sicker; finally unable to push the switch, it headed toward its own death.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This clinical picture could be changed by allowing the monkey to stimulate the positive systems which completely reversed the "dying" syndrome.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Motion pictures made of these experiments were shown at scientific meetings.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Personnel within both institutes saw them, displaying great interest, and demonstrations were made for visiting scientists.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    The directors of the two institutes received monthly reports on this brain stimulation work.
  :Русский: |-

  :Русский: |-

    This means that anybody with the proper apparatus can carry this out on a human being covertly, with no external signs that electrodes have been used on that person.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I feel that if this technique got into the hands of a secret agency, they would have total control over a human being and be able to change his beliefs extremely quickly, leaving very little evidence of what they had done."

    The director: "Since this is so, I would suggest that you do this briefing under special conditions, that it not be secret, that it be open."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "I learned in World War Two that the technical secrecy which these agencies use is its own enemy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The criteria which they apply, the 'need to know,' generate controls over scientists that cause their work to deteriorate.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The scientists are unable to talk to those who can probably offer the help and ideas they need to complete their research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    My impulse is not to give this briefing."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The director: "Well , that's up to you.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    With adequate publicity and by forcing them to agree to make it open, you can prevent misuse.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A representative of the group that wants the briefing will give you a call."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Several days later John received a telephone call from an unknown man within the United States government, who said, 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "Your director tells me that you are willing to give a briefing on your work with brain electrodes for controlling motivation by brain stimulation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He says that you have certain conditions for this briefing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    What are they?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "I will agree to inform members of the intelligence services on the use of brain electrodes and the techniques of inserting these electrodes and stimulating selected sites under the following conditions: First, the fact of this briefing will not be secret or under any form of security.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Second, everything I say at the meeting is to be unclassified, open, and repeatable subsequently by me or by others.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Third, at any future time I will be free to write about this conference without any restrictions in regard to what others at the conference say or the context which I present to them.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Fourth, any motion pictures or other materials which I present to the group are open.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They have either been published or will be published in the future in the open literature."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    There was a long silence before the man at the other end said, " I will have to refer this to the group that wants the briefing and the man who is organizing the meeting.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I will call you back in about ten days."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Ten days later the man called back.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "Your conditions are acceptable."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At the appointed time and place John walked into the meeting and looked around the long table.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He saw approximately thirty people, half of whom were in various uniforms of the United States government.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The man who had telephoned him introduced him to the meeting but did not volunteer to introduce anyone present to him.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John presented the essential work, showing the types of motivational systems, positive and negative, within the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He showed how the monkey could be taught rather rapidly to push a switch to stimulate its own positive systems and to push another switch to cut off stimulation in the negative systems.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He showed motion pictures of these findings with the monkeys and slides giving the details of the technique.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His demonstration took about one hour.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    When he finished there was a long silence.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    One man in a blue uniform asked the only question: "What are the medical indications for the use of brain electrodes in human patients?'' 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John: "The only current medical indications are two rather severe diseases: epilepsy which cannot be controlled by chemical means and Parkinson's disease."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The implications of this question, in the setting in which it was asked, were not lost upon John.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These techniques could become the most powerful brainwashing methods devised by man. 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    By this time John had already begun his momentous research in Florida on the brains of dolphins�research that was to have a profound effect on his life.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Following the briefing of the covert intelligence services on the subject of brain-electrode control of behavior, John received a telephone call from a man from the Sandia Corporation in New Mexico.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "I wish to leam the technique of inserting the sleeve guides into the heads of large animals," he said.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "On your next experiment with dolphins I would like to come, take motion pictures of the technique, and learn how to do this."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "I understand that the Sandia Corporation is doing classified work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I will agree to show you these techniques but the movies that you take, everything you leam, and the fact that I am teaching you these techniques must not be classified."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    On John's next trip to Florida the man from the Sandia Corporation photographed the experiments on dolphins.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He agreed to send a copy of the film to John and promised that the film itself would not be classified.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    After a few weeks, when a copy failed to arrive, John called the Sandia Corporation and was told that the film had been classified top secret.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John went to Washington and talked to a friend of his in the Department of Defense Office of Science.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He told his friend of the arrangement he had made with the man at Sandia.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Department of Defense man called the Sandia Corporation, talked to the security officer who had done the classification, and asked that the film be declassified and sent to him in Washington.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During his visit to Florida, the man from Sandia did not say how he was going to use the brain electrodes in animals.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He stated that he was working under security and could not tell John the end use for the brain-electrode techniques.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    After John left the National Institutes of Health and was searching for means to support the dolphin project in the Virgin Islands, he was asked by the Office of Naval Research to present the dolphin work at the Department of Defense in Washington.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He gave a talk to the assembled government people from the Navy and other agencies at the Pentagon.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    When John finished his talk, the man from the Office of Naval Research who had invited him to speak asked him to stay and hear a talk by someone from the Sandia Corporation about the use of brain electrodes in animals for carrying loads across mountain ranges.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John recognized the person's name; it was the man to whom he had taught the brain-electrode technique.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    After John had taken his place in the audience, a security officer came into the room and spoke to the man from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), who then asked John to leave the room with him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Out in the hall he said, "There is some problem about your security file.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You are not to be allowed to listen to the next presentation."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John, quite frightened and rather angry, said, "Why is that?"
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The ONR man said, " I do not know, but you cannot go back in that room."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John immediately went off to see his friend in the Department of Defense Office of Science and asked him to find out what was going on.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He called several people in the Department of Defense and finally told John, "All I can find out is that apparently, there is some problem with your security file having to do with the FBI.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I would appreciate your not giving my name when you inquire about this over at FBI.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    " 
  :Русский: |-
    " 
- :Английский: |-
    John said, "OK.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I promise not to use your name."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John went outside to a telephone and called a friend of his father's who at that time was the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He made an appointment and went to see him.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In his office in Treasury, his father's friend called J.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Edgar Hoover, who referred him to an assistant named Richard Krant.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He made an appointment for John with Mr. Krant.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Mr. Krant said, "What is the name of your friend in the Department of Defense who told you that this is a problem involving your security file at the FBI?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    " 
  :Русский: |-
    " 
- :Английский: |-
    John: "I cannot tell you his name until he gives me permission to do so.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I promised him that until he could thoroughly investigate this problem within the Department of Defense, I would not reveal his name.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At some future time he will relieve me of this promise."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Krant said, "OK.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I will be in contact with you.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Give me your telephone number and address in Miami."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The next day in Miami two tough-looking FB I agents came into John's house.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They sat down on each side of John.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In a very threatening tone, they began to quiz him about the name of the man in the Department of Defense who had said the FBI was at fault in this security matter.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Do you mean to say that the FB I is more worried about its own reputation than about the problem of a citizen falsely accused of being a security risk?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    They said, "We have been told to find out the name of this man and to give you no further information."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John, losing his temper: "Get on that telephone and call Krant and make it collect."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    One of the agents made the call and John began shouting at Krant into the telephone.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    " I agreed to tell you the name of that man when he released me from the promise that I made to him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Now please get these two thugs out of here."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    One of the agents came to the phone to talk to Krant, and, angrily, they both left the house.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John called his friend, the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and told him what had happened.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Within three weeks John received a telephone call from an Assistant Secretary of Defense who had a house in Florida.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He asked him to come see him about the security matter.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The Assistant Secretary of Defense said, "The fault in your security file was a clerical error.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The clerk had placed the record of a convicted criminal with the same name as yours in your file by mistake.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    What can we do to give you satisfaction in regard to this error?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John said, "I would like a letter of apology from the Secretary of Defense.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Copies of this letter are then to be placed in all intelligence agency files in Washington, including FBI, Air Force Intelligence, the Office of Naval Intelligence, CIA, and so forth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In that letter I wish it to be made clear that I am not a security risk, that I have never been a security risk.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I want it made clear that the mistake was made in the Department of Defense, Security Office."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He said, " I am afraid we are unable to acknowledge that the mistake was ours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We will be glad to write a letter of apology from the Secretary of Defense, but we cannot accept the blame.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We will agree to distribute that letter to the various intelligence services for their files."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The letter from the Secretary of Defense arrived the following week.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It was a very diplomatic apology, not taking the blame, and the distribution list was quoted at the bottom of the letter.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As Harper's magazine later revealed, the man from Sandia Corporation who followed John at the conference sponsored by the Office of Naval Research was indeed the man John had instructed in brain-electrode techniques on dolphins.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At that conference he had shown a movie of a mule going across very mountainous, steep slopes, controlled by a sun compass and brain electrodes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The mule's course was maintained in a perfectly straight line irrespective of terrain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The sun compass was hooked to the brain electrodes so that if the mule deviated from his course he was punished, and if he remained on course he was rewarded, by the appropriate electrodes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The mule could also be radio controlled from a distance to change his course, depending on the desires of those directing him.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Since the Sandia Corporation's main mission was the development of small atomic weapons, obviously this was a delivery system for such weapons which was not subject to the usual radar and other means of detection for metallic vehicles and for heatgenerating motors.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Such a method would be useful in limited warfare in rough terrain and would also be usable by terrorists.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Until new means of defense against this kind of attack were devised, it would have decisive surprise value.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The same means applied to human agents could be used to change their belief systems and also to control them at a distance.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Going over these events, John realized the truth of what Robert had told him during his psychoanalysis.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As soon as his research began to show results, though still far from his goal of achieving a safe way of influencing minds and brains by electronic methods, an immediate application was made by corporations, the covert intelligence services, and the military.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This demonstrated that, in the human social reality of the day, it would be impossible for him to carry out his own "secret" mission.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He saw that even if he achieved his goal it would be misused in the service of Man's warfare upon Man. Reluctantly, he decided to abandon the use of these methods and their further development.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt that Man was not yet ready for this kind of power.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He finally realized the political implications of his favorite research projects.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He abandoned the use of brain electrodes and electronic means of finding the relation of the mind to the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Almost reluctantly, he turned in other directions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to concentrate on communicating with dolphins without neurophysiological aids.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He pursued research on the effects of isolation using the flotation tank.

    # Learning How to Isolate Brain and Mind 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As progress developed in neurophysiological research concerning the physical performance of the brain itself, the scientist in the National Institute of Mental Health came upon a dichotomy in the interpretation of the actions of the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There were two schools of thought about the origins of conscious activity within the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The first school hypothesized that the brain needed stimulation from external reality to keep its conscious states going.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This school maintained that sleep resulted as soon as the brain was freed of external stimulation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When one retired to bed in the darkness of the night and the silence of the bedroom, the brain automatically went to sleep as a result of its release from the necessity of carrying on transactions with the external world.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The second school maintained that the activities of the brain were inherently autorhythmic; in other words, within the brain substance itself were cells that tended to continue their oscillations without the necessity of any external stimuli.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    According to this interpretation, the origins of consciousness were in the natural rhythms of the brain's cell circuitry itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The scientist contemplated the literature, talked to people involved in these two schools of thought, and decided to do some experiments to test the rival hypotheses.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He reviewed what was known about sleep, anesthesia, coma, accidental injury to the brain, and other causes for the apparent cessation of consciousness in human beings.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He looked at the physics and the biophysics of stimulation of the body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He considered what, according to our present scientific consensus, is thought to stimulate a body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He considered the effects of light and its stimulation of the eyes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He considered sound and its stimulation of the ears, touch and pressure and their stimulation of the skin and deep-lying end organs within the body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He took a good look at the effects of gravitation and its determination of body position and motion.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He looked at temperature differences, at clothing, at the effects of heat and cold.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that the important experiments must cut down these various forms of stimulation of the body to the minimum possible value, short of cutting nerve fibers going to the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized the essential feedback relationship between motion of the body and its self-stimulation during motion�the feedback from muscles, joints, bones, and skin.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He then devised a set of standards for isolating the body from all known forms of physical stimulation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His reasoning was somewhat as follows: Sound and light could be eliminated by well-known methods using unlit soundproof chambers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Motion of the body could be eliminated by voluntary effort with relaxation in the horizontal, gravitational, equipotential plane.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The usual bedroom situation, lying horizontal on a bed in a dark, silent room, satisfied these criteria of isolation.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The remaining sources of stimulation, however, were more difficult to remove.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When one is lying on a bed, the antigravity pressures on the surface of the body against the bed generate a stagnation of the blood flow to the skin and muscles on the underside of the body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This leads to stimulation which causes the body to tum during the night to relieve the slow flowing of the blood in those tissues under pressure on the bed.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The second group of stimuli which were not satisfied by the bed in the dark, silent room were those of temperature differences� a flow of air as a result of the convection currents over the body cools those parts exposed to the air.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Those parts not exposed to air remain warm; in fact, they may become too warm as a result of the local metabolism of the tissues not exposed to the air.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The tactile stimulation of the body against the bed and of the coverings over the body would also have to be eliminated.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    After a long and protracted study of these various sources of stimulation, the scientist received an inspiration to attempt the use of water flotation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Water would have the advantage of supporting the body without stimulating the skin if there were no motion of the body itself, or of the water relative to the body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If the water temperature were adjusted to soak up the heat given off by the metabolism of the body and the brain, the temperature problem could be solved.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Changes in temperature along the body axis and over the surface of the skin could be reduced below the level at which they stimulated the end organs of the skin.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The gravitational counterforces supporting the body would also be reduced by flotation below the level at which they could be detected by the end organs and the central nervous system of the body itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The scientist thus visualized a tank in which the body could be supported in water that would be maintained at the proper temperature to take care of the generation of heat within the body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This tank should be in a soundproof chamber which could be blacked out.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He sketched out the necessary apparatus and began to talk to his colleagues in the National Institutes of Health about this proposal.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that in order to furnish air to the person submerged in the water, he would need to draw upon the knowledge of respiratory apparatus learned during World War II in his high-altitude research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The person immersed would need a breathing mask which must be as nonstimulating as possible to the head and face.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The apparatus would have to furnish air�the oxygen in the air�and get rid of the carbon dioxide given off by the lungs as a result of the metabolism of the body burning the oxygen.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He talked the proposal over with his immediate superior, who suggested that he go to the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases where a man had worked with respiratory systems during World War II for the Office of Naval Research.

    He arranged for a luncheon with Dr. Heinz Specht in the cafeteria at the Clinical Center, and in the ensuing conversation Dr. Specht said, "By coincidence there is a suitable facility available in our institute which is not being used."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    That afternoon they walked over across the campus of the National Institutes of Health to a small, isolated building labeled T-2.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Dr. Specht explained that this was a high-altitude chamber in which animals were being subjected to equivalent altitudes in a series of experiments involving the chronic effect of lowered oxygen on their metabolism.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the back of the building they entered a double soundproof chamber through two locked doors.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Inside the chamber was a tank constructed during World War I I for experiments by the Office of Naval Research on the metabolism of underwater swimmers.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At this time the scientist realized that somehow or other he had been guided by something outside himself, and greater than himself, which he was later to call "coincidence control."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The major portion of the expensive apparatus which he needed already had been constructed and was available for his use.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The facility was ideally situated.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Within the institutes it was still possible to do research both on and in isolation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was no interference from high levels of administrative control.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The work could be as open-ended as the scientist wished it to be.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He could pursue the ideas and the plans he had set up without reference to the local scientific consensus.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This situation existed for a period of two years, during which time he was able to develop the method and to obtain the unexpected results of this research.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Since the scientist was a commissioned officer in the Public Health Service, he was on duty twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and had the freedom of the facility at any hour of the day or night.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that he must do the isolation work alone in order to obtain results uninfluenced by the social realities.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    To be in solitude for even brief periods of time meant being free of social transactions and the necessities of interaction with other personnel.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    For the isolation research he would disappear from the busy scene of the laboratory in which the neurophysiology work was taking place for periods of an hour or two hours, or he would disappear at night from his home without telling anyone what he was doing or where.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During the first year of the isolation work, the majority of his time was spent in devising satisfactory masks for underwater breathing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He went to the deep-diving research center of the Navy in Washington, accumulated a collection of underwater breathing masks, and tested them out in the tank in building T-2.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He devised a breathing system which would not impede the respiration of the subject floating in the water.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It was important to devise this system so that the carbon dioxide could be ventilated adequately and oxygen taken in in requisite amounts without any detectable pressure against respiration.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    It was found that all the standard masks, after a half hour or so in the water, pressed on the face, creating low levels of pain and furnishing unwanted stimulation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The scientist learned methods of making his own masks andfinally devised one made of latex rubber which covered the whole head and sealed around the neck.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    An inlet breathing tube came in close to the mouth and nose and an outlet breathing tube left from the same space.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the first models of this mask, there were no eye holes; it covered the head and face and was molded to fit the scientist's own head and face comfortably without pressure above the point of discomfort.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The water that flowed through the tank was tap water, the temperature of which was controlled by a photographic darkroom valve which regulated it at 93 degrees Fahrenheit.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It was found that the arms and legs of the body suspended in the water tended to sink.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They were held up by surgical rubber dam supports which were minimally stimulating to the skin.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This development of a satisfactory apparatus for breathing and for suspending the body took about six months.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Toward the end of 1954, proper experiments using this facility were begun.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The scientist had succeeded in reducing all forms of stimulation to the minimum possible value, and had immersed himself in the darkness, the quiet, and the wetness for many hours at a time.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Within the first few hours of exposure with satisfactory apparatus, he found out which school of thought was correct: the theory that the brain contained self-sustaining oscillators and did not need external forms of stimulation to stay conscious had been proven.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Despite the fact that this choice between the two theories was demonstrated after the first few hours, the research continued as additional data emerged that were of far greater interest.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The scientist made his second discovery: this environment furnished the most profound relaxation and rest that he had ever experienced in this life.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It was far superior to a bed for purposes of recuperation from the stresses of the day's work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He discovered that two hours in the tank gave him the rest equivalent to eight hours of sleep on a bed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The two hours were not necessarily spent in sleep.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that there were many, many states of consciousness, of being, between the usual wide-awake consciousness of participating in an external reality and the unconscious state of deep sleep.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that he could have voluntary control of these states; that he could have, if he wished, waking dreams, hallucinations; total events could take place in the inner realities that were so brilliant and so "real" they could possibly be mistaken for events in the outside world.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In this unique environment, freed of the usual sources of stimulation, he discovered that his mind and his central nervous system functioned in ways to which he had not yet accustomed himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He became a bit anxious about these tank experiences.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that there were apparent presences which were either created in his imagination or programmed into his brain by unknown sources when he was isolated in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He experienced the presence of persons who he knew were at a distance from the facility.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He experienced strange and alien presences with whom he had had no known previous experience.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At the time his belief system was such that the brain contained the mind; there were no possibilities such as distant sources communicating with him in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had had no experience in his scientific work which could account for the experiences that he underwent.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He very cautiously talked to his psychiatric colleagues in 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    the National Institute of Mental Health.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He did not tell them of his fears or of his nonconsensus reality experiences.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He emphasized the deep relaxation and the benefits derived from his experiences in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Two of the psychiatric researchers decided to try the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The first went in for two hours and came out and reported that nothing had happened.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He did not return to the work.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The second did a series of experiments on himself and became hyperenthusiastic about the method, and when he left the National Institute of Mental Health he set up his own tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The director of the National Institute of Mental Health Psychiatric Research Division asked the scientist to present a paper at a research conference of the American Psychiatric Association on the results of the use of the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    About this time the scientist had started to review the literature on solitude, isolation, and confinement.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He read everything available on single-handed sailings across oceans, on solitudinous experiences in the polar night; he studied the solitary confinement reports on prisoners of war and prisoners in prisons in the United States.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He found that in none of these situations was the physical isolation as complete as it was in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Most of these experiences had various degrees of stress associated with them due to protracted periods of solitude and of exposure to physical and social extremes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Few of the results were pertinent to his immediate findings except that a person isolated from his own society was likely to know the same freedom and the same variation from the usual experiences of the consensus reality that the scientist had found himself in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In his scientific paper he very cautiously reported only a few of his less intense experiences.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His caution came from the realization that his colleagues would make judgments about his own mental health if he revealed anything more.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Many hours that he had spent in the tank were devoted to his own self-analysis, a continuation of his psychoanalytic work with Robert from 1949 to 1953.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The tank experiences gave him new access to bodily pleasure which he found difficult to integrate with his rather, as Robert had called it, Calvinistic conscience.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His conflicts with sexual expression, sexual transactions, took up a good deal of his time.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The resting body accumulated positive energies that were expressible sexually to an almost intolerable level.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to recognize the intrinsic nature of sexual drives.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His parallel studies in neurophysiology revealed the sources of the sexual energy within the central nervous system.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to see that these sources existed in himself, in his own brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to see also that the negative energies of anger, of pain, of guilt, were also resident in his own brain, even as he had found them in the monkey brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Through such experiences in the tank he began to realize that the cerebral cortex of the human brain is so large that it can suppress, or repress, and hold in abeyance, expression of both the positive, sexual, loving energies and of the negative punishing energies present in the lower circuits.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that one does not necessarily have to be a victim of these lower systems, that they can be sublimated or controlled in many more ways than those open to the monkey.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to see, through his own experiences and the findings of the laboratory, that the huge cerebral cortex of the human was capable of generating any number of alternative courses for the use of these primitive energies.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As he developed the method of tank isolation and began to speak of these results with his colleagues, he discovered a good deal of apparent interest in using the tank method for purposes other than self-analysis and self-exploration.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A large section of the psychiatric research division at that time was devoted to research on lysergic acid diethylamide tartrate (LSD-25).
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The scientist's colleagues in this research suggested that he use LSD in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He refused, saying that he wanted to develop a physiological and psychological baseline of research without using chemical agents first.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At that time he did not even contemplate using LSD in the tank; the complexities of the research were not yet sufficiently worked out in his mind to do what he then called 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "contaminating the results with drug studies."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He stayed in contact with the LSD research through his colleagues, however, and attended many seminars on the subject within the institute.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He was bothered by the basic belief systems of psychiatric research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt that they were not scientifically based, that they were generated in psychology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis, none of which were open-ended but tended rather to be closed systems of reasoning, loosely based on Freud's theory of the unconscious mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In his own analysis he had found that these theories were extremely inadequate as models which would work in the isolated mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He had found in his tank experiences that far more was happening than could be accounted for in such theories.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The psychiatric profession was not utilizing the full potential of the mind and the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their model was limiting, limited, closed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The explanations for the effects of LSD on the human mind were also limited and closed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    LSD was called psychotomimetic; in other words, as if inducing psychosis in an apparently normal person.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The belief of the head of the Psychiatric Research Division was that each person had implicitly in him or her a potential psychosis which could be elicited by LSD or by sufficient stress.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In other words, selfinduced and self-controlled states were not possible once a "psychosis" started.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Being exposed to this kind of reasoning, day in and day out, at the National Institute of Mental Health made the scientist very cautious about giving any further information on what was happening to him in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Not until he left the National Institutes of Health and established his own institute in the Virgin Islands was he willing to explore further these deep sources within the human mind which he had detected.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As a by-product of his research in the tank and his work on the brains of the monkeys, he began to consider doing research on animals that had brains equal to or larger than that of man. At the time, he felt that it was important to find out if the large cerebral cortex of a mammal other than man could control the lower systems of positive and negative energies which he had found in monkeys.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In conversations at an international congress of physiology with physiologists about animals with brains larger than that of man, the dolphin was mentioned.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Deciding to pursue the matter a year after he had started the tank work, he found that there were dolphins available for research in Florida.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    With eight other colleagues from various universities he went to Florida to investigate the possibility of doing research on the brains of dolphins.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Later he went to Florida alone and did crucial experiments on dolphins using brain electrodes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He discovered that they did have control over the stimulation of these primitive energy systems by means of their large cerebral cortex.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A dolphin stimulated in the negative regions would not express rage but would shake all over and attempt to terminate such stimulation without panicking.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The monkeys had panicked; the dolphins did not.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found the dolphins would control self-stimulation of their positive systems with a great degree of discrimination.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He also found that they would use their vocal output to obtain positive-system stimulation, something that the monkeys could not do; thus, the dolphin and the human could control accesses to pleasure vocally.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The monkeys' brains were not large enough to do this.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their cerebral cortices had definite limits in the programmatic control of lower systems.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Thus the scientist discovered that the isolation tank could be, in his hands at least, a fertile source of new ideas, new experiences, new integrations.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It also brought up past experiences and events which he could not explain with his present limited models of both the human mind and the human brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    From the tank came the idea of the dolphin research and the stimulus for it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    From the tank came a new appreciation of the depth within the human mind unfathomed by previous methods of research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to see sources of inspiration, usually neglected, which could be encouraged and realized through the experience of the isolation tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During this period, though he didn't know it, he was preparing the ground for his own expanded awareness and the achievement of states of being (reminiscent of his early childhood) which he had not yet fully integrated into his personality and was yet to experience totally.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    While he was at the National Institutes of Health, the tank work, like the brain-electrode work, also became subject to the politics of the human consensus reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As the isolation research in the tank became known throughout the government, various individuals called on him to find out about it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Among them were researchers working under the auspices of the Army in regard to brainwashing of captured prisoners of war.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As was the case with the brain-electrode work, he insisted that such conferences not be classified, secret or otherwise.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was asked if the isolation tank could be used to change belief systems of persons under coercion.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Could the isolation tank be used in the service of brainwashing?
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John visualized situations in which this method could be used under coercion; by careful control of the stimulation of isolated persons, their belief systems could be changed in directions desired by the controlling persons.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John shrank from working out the consequences of this use of his isolation technique.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His experience with the possible misuse of brain electrodes in the service of covert operations had taught him that this isolation technique could also be misused.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Such approaches to the research further convinced him that he could not continue to work within governmental agencies.

    # Conference of Three Beings 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    One day in 1958 John entered the tank room, put on the mask, and immersed himself in the water for the last time at the National Institutes of Health.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had finally realized that within the government it was impossible to do the research that he wished to do.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Inevitably, subtly, those in charge of research for the National Institute of Mental Health were asking to control the isolation-tank work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    And those in charge of brain research in the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness were beginning to exert controls on the work on the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In this session in the tank, he planned to review what he had learned over the last five years in regard to research on the brain and the mind and the support of this research.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John went through his now more-or-less standard procedure of relaxing every muscle in his body while floating in the water.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He then relaxed his mind and let go of the residues of the day's activities.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Quite suddenly he was in a new space, a new domain.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He left his human body behind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He left his human mind behind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He became a point of consciousness, of awareness, in an empty, infinite space filled with light.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Slowly two presences, two Beings, began to approach him from a distance.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was a three-way exchange of direct thought, of direct meaning, of direct feeling with no words.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Later he was to write up the experience as if words were used, as if the two Beings had spoken to him in English, as if he had become the Third Being.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The conference of the three Beings was taking place in a dimensionless space, the spaceless set of dimensions somewhere near the third planet of a small solar system dominated by a type-G star.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The organization which they represented he would later call the Earth Coincidence Control Office (ECCO).
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The First Being speaks: "We are meeting at this particular space-time juncture in order to review the evolution of a vehicle that we control on the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He is at another transition point in his training.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We need to review what he has done, what he is thinking, what his motivations are.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We must determine what the future of his mission can be within the evolutionary speed limit allowed the humans on that planet."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Second Being: "You, the First Being, and I, the Second Being, have been controlling the coordination of coincidences of this agent on Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I feel it is important that we state all of this very clearly for the benefit of the Third Being, who has been responsible for that human agent.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It is important that he not exceed the evolutionary speed limit at this particular time; however, we realize that there is a certain discrepancy existing among the humans, that their evolution is proceeding extremely rapidly in certain areas and is going backward in others.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It is the purpose of this conference among the three of us to make sure that the Third Being controls him so that he stays within certain well-defined limits and avoids the kinds of catastrophes certain other agents of ours have experienced on that planet.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Let us listen to the report of the Being who has been in charge of the vehicle on the planet."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "Currently my agent is in a quandary.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I need this conference to know in what direction he is to move next.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The vehicle that he inhabits is now in a deep trance state and is willing to share with us the sources of this quandary.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "As you both know he has a carefully constructed cover story in which he has invested a good deal of time, effort, and training.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    All three of us are well acquainted with the rather arduous steps that he has been taking in his human form.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-

    "He went through a process which humans call psychoanalysis.
  :Русский: |-

    Psychoanalysis to us is a means of educating humans in how to remain human, at the same time keeping sufficient independence of that state so as to be aware of our existence.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Psychoanalysis also furnishes the human agents with the current rationalizations and basic assumptions upon which humans operate.
  :Русский: |-

    It helps them develop their cover story so that they will not reveal our existence or our influence.

    His analyst taught him to look more critically at this particular aspect of his mission.

    In the first he believes that the mind is the computational software of the brain, that the brain evolved on the planet Earth from the forebears of Man and generated Man's consciousness.

    In the second system, he believes in us.

    # Simulation and Experience

- :Английский: |-
    Floating in the tank John slowly came back to his body, to the tank, to the human reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His exuberance faded and his memory of the conference of the three Beings faded rapidly.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His realization that he was still in a government installation inhibited further thought along these lines.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He resolved to leave the government to gain more freedom to do what he had to do.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Gradually the sense of his human mission reasserted itself and he became once again the scientist.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    His protective skepticism also reasserted itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He said to himself, "This must be another of my 'imaginary' simulations of reality."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The thought occurred to him, I'd best go write this up quickly before the human consensus reality takes over completely.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    After showering and putting on human clothes once more, he sat in his office and considered how much of the experience he should write down.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    What would be the reaction of an eventual audience to this report of his experience?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He considered his simulation of his public image, his simulation of the consensus reality, his simulation of "proper science."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He weighed the repercussions from the consensus reality of other humans that might affect publication of a book containing such a report.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized the very narrow framework in which the book must be written in order to be published, bought, read, and understood by a sufficient number of people to carry out the necessities of the mission assigned to him.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As he sat in his office, the first gray light of dawn was appearing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As he considered what to write, the sun came up and shone upon his back.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt his body, he felt the reality of his office, he felt the reality of writing down what had happened to him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His biocomputer began to generate objections to writing this down.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He thought, Was it all merely a dream, an imaginary situation, a science-fiction script?
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He thought many alternatives out, considering them all, and decided to write, as best he could, the inner reality as an actual happening insofar as he was allowed to report it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Then he reviewed his theory of the contained versus the uncontained mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The mind contained within the brain is the result of the evolutionary process occurring on this planet.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The proper atoms accumulated in this portion of the universe at the proper distance from the sun, at the proper temperature.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The coalescence of the atoms into a planet, into an atmosphere, into water upon the surface of that planet formed the seas and oceans.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The storms over the ocean produced lightning, streaking through the atmosphere and forming nitrogen compounds which fell into the ocean; there combining with the carbon of carbon dioxide, the atoms coalesced into long chains of peptides and eventually proteins.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The peptides and the proteins formed small balls of peculiar construction.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These balls floated in the bosom of the primordial soup of the seas.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The balls coalesced, joined one another, incorporated a new structure.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The new structure became the primordial viruses; the viruses joined, became the first bacteria.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The bacteria accumulated further layers and became the first protozoan cells.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The protozoans joined in colonies, forming the first sponges and the first coral.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Evolution proceeded over millions of years, resulting in the worms, the starfish, the tunicates.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Within these organisms new cells developed, specialized for conduction of nervous impulses.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The prototype of the nervous system began to evolve in the jellyfish, the worms, the starfish, the tunicates.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The fish evolved, the nervous system moved toward the head end of the new organisms.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The distance receptors, the eyes, the lateral line organs all became oriented forward in the direction of motion.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The lungfish evolved, climbed out on the land, and looked at the new territory.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The amphibians evolved in the sea, climbed out on the land, became adapted to a combined dry-land-water existence.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The reptiles evolved from the amphibians.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Some reptiles returned to the sea and slowly but surely evolved into huge forms which gradually became the primitive dolphins and whales.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The nervous system grew and grew and, in the whales, evolved to the size of the humans to come fifty million years later.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The reptiles on the land gave rise to the first landborne mammals.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The mammals climbed in the trees and grew.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their brains grew larger and larger, and finally they evolved into the monkeys, the apes, the human species in the prototypic form.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The prototype humans evolved further, increasing their brain mass.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Meanwhile, in the sea, the dolphins and whales evolved larger nervous systems that equaled the present human one thirty million years ago.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In each of the large evolved animals, including the human, were brains now capable of new choices, of new directions, of new control over the environment and over the self.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The contained mind, as we know it today, evolved to its present complex distribution.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As Man became aware of his own awareness, as Man became aware of his own brain, as Man became aware that he was interdependent with other men, as Man built, created, and lived in his human consensus reality, he lost contact with his planet.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He developed delusions of grandeur in which he was the preeminent species.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He gave himself a special creation and a special evolution separate from that of the planet and from the other creatures created upon it by the evolutionary process.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Man created a special origin for himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He represented his consciousness as a "soul."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The soul was a divine portion of God, the God that he had created in his own contained mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He assumed that his mind was part of a Universal Mind, uncontained in any brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He peopled his external reality with simulations of the operations of minds greater than his.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He worshiped these minds.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He organized churches.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He wrote books.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He wrote handbooks of God, called the Bible, the Koran, the Sutras, the Vedas, the Upanishads.
  :Русский: |-

    Various men and women went into solitude, into hermitages, into remote cells, into caves, into the deserts and experienced realities which they called spiritual.
  :Русский: |-

    Their minds contained in their brains generated experiences beyond the planet, beyond their human form, beyond their understanding.

    Slowly Man began to investigate his own material nature.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He studied his brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He studied damaged human brains.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He studied the results of damage to brains.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He explored the inner realities of those with intact brains, those with small brains, those with large brains.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He traced his own genetic code, his inheritance carried forward in his three-billion-year evolution from primordial matter.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He studied the complex assemblages of that matter.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He investigated the primitive particles giving rise to that matter.
  :Русский: |-

    He studied the molecular configurations present in living organisms and in his own body and brain.
  :Русский: |-

    Man's evolution began to be what Man conceived it to be: what he thought his fellowman was, his human organizations were, his speech, writing, computers, and the vast diversity of beliefs about self were.
  :Русский: |-

    Man warred on Man. Man killed Man. Man killed other organisms on the planet by the hundreds of thousands and the millions.
  :Русский: |-

    Man's own thoughts of himself were as a divinely special creature, evolved and designed to exploit the planet for his own survival and economic gain.
  :Русский: |-

    His laws were designed to regulate his behavior with regard to other humans and to control the other organisms as if they were a part of his own divinely inherited property.

    He domesticated many animals; those who could not be domesticated were killed.

    The extinction of species proceeded rapidly.
  :Русский: |-

    Finally some men became aware that if this course continued, the planet would be bereft of many species, many more than those that had already become extinct through Man's efforts.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The whales and dolphins of the sea were being killed in the name of the economic religion of Man. His conceit that other species were an economic resource for his exploitation was killing off huge cultures, huge histories of which Man was not yet aware.
  :Русский: |-

    Man's development of speech and man-to-man communication isolated him from the possibilities of communication with other brains as large as his and larger.
  :Русский: |-

    The whale and dolphin cultures were being decimated, their histories stored in their huge brains decimated, as the oldest and largest of the whales were selected for slaughter.
  :Русский: |-

    As the scientist reviewed this history he felt as if he were in a human trap, constructed over the millennia.

    John thought, "Thus, in the sermon for today, if my mind is contained within my brain, then the three Beings are either leakages of information into a leaky mind, or they are constructed simulations for unknown purposes, created within my own brain from sources not yet available to me consciously.
  :Русский: |-

    As Freud would say, they are constructions from my unconscious, generated by belief systems put into me as a child.

    "If my mind contained in the brain is leaky to sources of information not yet contained within our knowledge, within our science, then there may be other intelligences in this universe with whom we can communicate and do communicate when we are in the proper state of consciousness and proper state of being.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If the mind and the brain are leaky, then they are available for networks of communication beyond our present understanding.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If the mind is uncontained, then the Beings have an objective, verifiable existence which others can also share.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If I believe in the uncontained mind, then the program I have outlined here can be believed by some others, and we can have a parallel programming into his belief system in which the Beings are 'real.' 
  :Русский: |-

    Thus we construct another simulated reality as if true.

    "If the mind in the brain has sources of information beyond the present science, then there is something or someone communicating with us.

    We arbitrarily assign descriptions of this someone or something which correspond to ourselves.

    We project our simulations on the information coming in to us from unknown sources.

    Our brains are limited valves, cloaking what works on this planet with what is fed to us but does not work on this planet.
  :Русский: |-

    If we believe that what works is all there is, then we close our minds and contain them in order to do the empirical job of surviving and generate the illusion of a human evolution on this planet.

    # The Lilly Tank 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We have been seeking answers to the question of what happens to a brain &amp; its contained mind in the relative absence of physical stimulation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In neurophysiology, thi9 is one form of the question: Freed of normal efferent and afferent activities, does the activity of the brain soon become that of coma or sleep, or is there some inherent mechanism which keeps it going, a pacemaker of the "awake" type of activity?
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In our experiments, the subject is suspended with the body and all but the top of the head immersed in a tank containing slowly flowing water at 34.5� C.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (94.5� F.), wears a blacked-out mask (enclosing the whole head) for breathing, and wears nothing else.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The water temperature is such that the subject feels neither hot nor cold.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Tne experience is such that one factually feels the supports and the mask, but not much else; a large fraction of the usual pressures on the body caused by gravity are lacking.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The sound level is low; one hears only one's own breathing and some faint water sounds from the piping; the water-air interface does not transmit airborne sounds very efficiently.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It is one of the most even and monotonous environments I have experienced.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After the initial training period, no observer is present.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Immediately after exposure, the subject writes personal notes on his experience.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In these experiments, the subject always has a full nigh f s rest before en tering the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Instructions are to inhibit all movement as far as possible.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    An initial set of training exposures overcomes the fears of the situation itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the tank, the following stages have been experienced: (1) For about the first three-quarters of an hour, the day's residues are predominant.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    One is aware of the surroundings, recent problems, etc.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (2) Gradually, one begins to relax and more or less enjoy the experience.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The feeling of being isolated in space and having nothing to do is restful and relaxing at this stage.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (3) But slowly, during the next hour, a tension develops which can be called a "stimulus-action" hunger; hidden methods of self-stimulation develop: twitching muscles, slow swimming movements (which cause sensations as the water flows by the skin), stroking one finger with another, etc.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If one can inhibit such maneuvers long enough, intense satisfaction is derived from later self-stimulations.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (4) If inhibition can win out, the tension may ultimately develop to the point of forcing the subject to leave the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (5) Meanwhile, the attention is drawn powerfully to any residual stimulus: the mask, the suspension, each come in for their share of concentration.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Such residual stimuli become the whole content of consciousness to an almost unbearable degree.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (6) If this stage is passed without leaving the tank, one notices that one's thoughts have shifted from a directed type of thinking about problems to reveries and fantasies of a highly personal and emotionally charged nature.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These are too personal to relate publicly, and probably vary greatly from subject to subject.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The individual reactions to such fantasy material also probably varies considerably, from complete suppression to relaxing and enjoying them.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (7) If the tension and the fantasies are withstood, one may experience the furthest stage which we have yet explored: projection of visual imagery.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I have seen this once, after a two-and-one-half hour period.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The black curtain in front of the eyes (such as one "sees" in a dark room with eyes closed) gradually opens out into a three-dimensional, dark, empty space in front of the body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This phenomenon captures one's interest immediately, and one waits to find out what comes next.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Gradually forms of the type sometimes seen in hypnogogic states appear.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In this case, they were small, strangely shaped objects with selfluminous borders.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A tunnel whose inside "space" seemed to be emitting a blue light then appeared straight ahead.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    About this time, this experiment was terminated by a leakage of water into the mask through a faulty connector to the inspiratory tube.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In our experiments, we notice that after immersion the day apparently is started over, i.e. the subject feels as if he has just arisen from bed afresh; this effect persists, and the subject finds he is out of step with the dock for the rest of that day.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He also has to readjust to social intercourse in subtle ways.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The night of the day of the exposure he finds that his bed exerts great pressure against his body.
  :Русский: |-

    No bed is as comfortable as floatingin water.

    Thomas in the Caribbean Sea where he could build his new laboratory.
  :Русский: |-

    He invested what money he had available and was able to obtain other funds from the National Science Foundation.
  :Русский: |-

    The building of the laboratory began.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    At the National Institutes of Health, he realized that physiological research would be needed in the new institute in order to support work involving communication with the dolphins as well as the tank work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He would need scientific colleagues to do the physiological work and another location for that work outside the Virgin Islands.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found colleagues to control the physiological work and set up a laboratory in Miami while the laboratory in the Virgin Islands was being built.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the next few years the two laboratories became operational.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The brain work (physiology) and the mind work (communication with dolphins and tank research) were to be split between Miami and the Virgin Islands.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The two laboratories were far enough apart so that the personnel would not interfere with one another.
  :Русский: |-

    Those who wished to pursue the physiology work were in Miami; those who wished to pursue the communication work were in the Virgin Islands.

    At the Virgin Islands laboratory an isolation tank was built.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In Miami a thorough study of the brain of the dolphin was initiated by Dr. Peter Morgane under John's direction.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    When John was satisfied that the laboratory in Miami and the dolphin communication research in St.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Thomas were functioning satisfactorily, he started a series of isolation tank experiences himself in the Virgin Islands.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Through his former colleagues in the National Institute of Mental Health, he obtained some LSD-25 from the Sandoz Company.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At that time he had a fellowship from the National Institutes of Health and was permitted to do the LSD research under their auspices.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He disguised his true motivations for using the LSD-25 in a research proposal "to see its effects upon dolphins."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He carried out a series of experiments on six dolphins and found the critical dose for the first behavioral change detectable by human observers; 100 micrograms was a sufficient dose for these effects.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It had previously been found that this was approximately the critical dose for behavioral changes in small monkeys and in humans.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He concluded that the body weight of the particular subject made no difference in the effects of LSD.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Most other chemical agents tried on animals and humans, such as barbiturates, seemed to depend on a body-weight effect.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The dilution of the chemical in the blood and other body fluids did not make the same difference with LSD.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It looked as if LSD was somehow concentrated by the brain no matter the size of the body over a range from approximately three pounds of body weight (monkey) to four hundred and fifty pounds of body weight (dolphin).
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    After he found this critical value, he decided to continue the initial work with LSD on himself, alone in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the following two years he was able to carry out a series of such experiments.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At this time John felt that he had completed certain preliminaries necessary to start the new research with LSD.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In i960 he had written a book at the instigation of Herman Wouk which was published by Doubleday the following year under the title Man and Dolphin.
  :Русский: |-

    From 1961 to 1964 he had obtained support for the laboratories in Miami and in St.

    Supervising the work in the two laboratories required him to travel from Miami to St.
  :Русский: |-

  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Thomas, using LSD, without interfering with the dolphin research either in St.
  :Русский: |-

    Thomas or in Miami.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Since leaving the NIH he had not had a tank available and missed the inner disciplines and help of the tank in the problems of external reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt strongly that it was necessary to get back to tank work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that the LSD plus the tank experiments must be done covertly; the existence of this research had to be hidden from his colleagues and from those in support of the dolphin programs.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His mission to penetrate ever more deeply into the human mind, using his own as an example of that of his species, drove him on into rather dangerous regions in terms of the social conseasus reality and his own reputation and public integrity.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At that time there were rumblings in the medical research circles that those who took LSD were somehow different from those who did not.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was a tendency among the medical researchers to discount the findings of those who had taken it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John realized the various causes for this.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Some researchers had become hyperenthusiastic in an almost unreasonable way about LSD and its effect on their own minds.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Others who had taken it were frightened off by their first sessions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Various extreme claims were being made for its therapeutic benefits in certain diseases, including alcoholism and neurosis.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Those who had not taken it did not realize its profound effect on the human mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Some of those who had taken it several times and were trained in its effects upon themselves and patients were claiming benefits which could not be visualized or understood by their opposition.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Certain researchers had dropped out of the research field and were publicly proclaiming LSD as some special "sacrament" in new religions for all humans.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Various patients who had taken many therapeutic sessions with LSD were writing books containing accounts of experiences that no rational, consensus-reality-oriented person who had not taken LSD could understand or could keep from fearing.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John's previous work in the tank had convinced him that the range of the human mind was far greater than those who had not taken LSD had ever suspected.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was aware of a scientific puzzle in the effects of LSD on the human mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had become intrigued enough to explore these effects directly on himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Bazett-Haldane criterion of research on human subjects, "Do on yourself that which you would do on others before you do it on others," was still his scientific ideal.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Driven by his curiosity and that ideal, he decided to initiate this series of experiments on himself in the tank in St.
  :Русский: |-

    The human brain, a living computer with unknown properties.
  :Русский: |-

    A biocomputer.
  :Русский: |-

    Its properties only dimly understood.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Its programs for fear, for anger, for love, for pleasure, for pain built into its structure, its circuitry.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Circuits for all these feelings are primitive, inherited in the genetic code.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Th e mind is the software of that biocomputer.

    Th e observer located in that brain is the result of the brain's computations.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As pain and pleasure are inalterably linked in the biofeedback of the brain with the body, so is the observer computed in the large cerebral cortex.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The observer is a programmer resident in the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Th e programmer is the agent within the brain.

    Th e self is the operator contained within the brain in self-reflexive circuitry in the cerebral cortex.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Is the self immersed in the brain anything more than the computed result of the brain's software?

    Is the mind anything more than the computational activities of that brain?

    Before starting the first injection of LSD into his thigh muscles, John wrote this preprogram for the whole series of experiments.
  :Русский: |-

    These were the questions that he set out to answer insofar as he was able.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Nothing in his first two training sessions with LSD supervised by a friend in California had given him the answers to them.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His analysis of the results of those two sessions did not give him sufficiently accurate answers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Everything he had learned from them reinforced his belief in the containment of his mind within the computational domains of his brain.
  :Русский: |-

    Everything that had occurred in those two sessions could be accounted for by the contained- mind hypothesis in which he believed at that time.

    "No one is to take LSD in solitude without a guide.

    His floating body shook with the fear; it fast became terror and then panic.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was tempted to climb out of the tank but realized that this in itself might have been a dangerous procedure, climbing over the eight-foot-high wall under the influence of LSD.

    He stayed floating and began his preprogramming once again.

    The electrical excitations traveling through the body were very familiar.

    He exerted the discipline learned in previous tank work and allowed the body to relax in the presence of the "electrical storms" moving through it.

    The darkness, the silence, the wetness, and the warmth disappeared.
  :Русский: |-

    The external reality of the tank disappeared.
  :Русский: |-

    His body disappeared: his conscious awareness of the bodily process, of the existence of the body.

    His knowledge of the brain disappeared; his knowledge of self was all that was left.

    "I am becoming a human being.

    The name of this body is John.

    John does not believe in me.

    He believes that he lives in this body caught from birth to death within its confines."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly John returned to his body with exuberance, ecstatic enthusiasm.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He remembered his initial fear on starting the experiment.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "The body is reactivated, the resident human is back, recreated in that body.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    The other two Beings have instructed me not to reveal my presence here as yet.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Despite his close brush with death several weeks ago in which he experienced me and the others, he has yet to accept our existence.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He has yet to accept me as his constant companion.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    My instructions call for maintaining this unawareness of me until he can absorb it without becoming inoperative upon the planet Earth."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John lay in the tank remembering his experience in the vast universe, in the multidimensions beyond his understanding.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His discipline as a scientist slowly but surely reasserted itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He climbed out of the tank, took a shower, and wrote his notes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized somehow that they were incomplete; there were instructions he could barely remember which sounded somewhat as follows: 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "This agent is not to remember all of this experience.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It will be stored below his levels of awareness in his biocomputer.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At the appropriate times in the future he will remember more and more of this experience, when he can integrate it without demolishing his role in the human consensus reality of the planet Earth."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John managed to write these words, and then his skepticism asserted itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He went back over what he could remember of the experience and decided that none of it proved or disproved the contained-mind hypothesis.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He reasoned that the effect of LSD may be merely to cut down on the awareness of the observer and the operator within the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The observer may become more and more isolated from those trappings he can identify himself with as a human being.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The computational capacity of the biocomputer may be reduced by the LSD, reducing the size of the effective domain of the observer-operator, disconnecting him from his body, isolating him within his cortex from computations of the lower systems within his brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    With increasing containment of self under the influence of LSD-25, he may then be free to compute and to generate any inner reality which he chooses up to certain limits.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At these limits other computations would take over his identity.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He would be reduced further until his awareness would become that of a self-reflexive system chasing its own tail, total feedback of self upon self.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    With this feeling he suddenly realized that LSD properly used in isolation could generate an attachment to anything, anybody, any idea, any concept, any hypothesis.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The containedmind aspect of his previous work on the brain, his psychoanalytic work, his empirical living on the planet Earth in a human society� all would favor the contained-mind hypothesis.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Under the influence of LSD he was in love with it, literally "in a trance" at the behest of his previous human brainwashing, education, exposure to the ideas of others, which became programmatic agents within his own mind, within his own brain, and of which he considered himself the victim.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    His work in neurophysiology, his work in medicine, his work in psychoanalysis all generated this particular belief system of the contained mind within the contained brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Is there anything more than the contained mind within the contained brain?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Was that reality which I experienced in the tank with the LSD anything more than a body floating in a tank and a brain under the influence of a chemical?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Are any other theories merely carry-overs from my childhood when I believed in the soul, in God, in Heaven, and in Hell?
  :Русский: |-

    The warring belief systems of his religion, of his science, and of himself split him into a nonintegrated, nonaccepting, fighting human.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "There is a fleeting memory of a Being taking over my body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Was that a real experience or was that me split into two parts, one part believing in the existence of a soul, the other part disbelieving in the soul and trying to destroy the belief?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Is that Being�what would be called in the Catholic Church and other religions, a soul, a spirit�a part of God?"

    After writing up his notes, John went to see Margaret, who was working with the three dolphins, Peter, Sissy, and Pamela.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the midst of his enthusiasm, he attempted to speak to her of his experiences.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Margaret: "Look, John, I am devoting my time, my energy, my love, and my life to working with Peter, Sissy, and Pam.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I want no interference with my aims for that work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If you want to do your experiments on solitude and LSD, please keep them in the isolation room.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The rest of the laboratory is devoted to the dolphins and to my work with them.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I am not curious or interested in what you are doing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    My own previous personal experiences are such that I do not want to discuss these experiments.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I will be your safety man, keeping intrusions of others away from the isolation room.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Beyond that I cannot help you and refuse to do so."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John thought that this would be the perfect situation with no cross-programming between him and Margaret in this series of experiments.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The laboratory was isolated and she could protect him from intrusions during the series to come.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    With this in mind he said, "OK, Margaret, I appreciate what you are doing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    No one has the dedication, nor has ever had the dedication that you are devoting to the dolphins.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I will not interfere with that.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As I told you when you were given control of this laboratory, I will interfere minimally with your aims to teach the dolphins English.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The separation of your research from the isolation work is perfect.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If I attempt in my enthusiasm to encroach on your territory, please feel free to warn me off."
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    John returned to his office and bedroom above the laboratory.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Margaret returned to her living quarters with the dolphins.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The next day he found a great peace for a period of about twelve hours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found new integrations, a new appreciation of his body, of his mind, and of the vastness of his ignorance.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    That night he went out and looked at the brilliant stars unimpeded by city lights.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He went down to the dark dolphin pool and watched the three dolphins swimming together.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt a communion with those dolphias that he had not felt before.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that they, too, had a consciousness, an awareness, and a compassion for Man. He realized the essential uniqueness of his planet and its contained species on the land and in the sea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had a new appreciation of the oceans and their contained cultures of dolphins and whales.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt a new sense of communion with those vast, ancient cultures so different from our own.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He realized, confined in the human body, his difference from the dolphins confined in their bodies.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to see that their complex communication was something more than he had conceived of before.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The thought occurred to him, "Can it be that while I was floating in that tank above the dolphin pool, they somehow communicated with me by means unknown at present?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their brains are larger than ours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their silent associational cortex is larger than ours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Can it be that their minds are also larger than ours?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Can it be that their communication with one another is far more complete than ours, man to man, man to woman?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They can see inside one another's bodies with their echo sonar system, they know far more intimately what is going on in one another's bodies.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If I confine my thoughts only to our science as we know it, they still have a much more complete appreciation of one another than do we."
  :Русский: |-

    John considered the dolphin pool, the dolphins, the ocean, the stars, the Milky Way, the tank, the laboratory, and his duties as a human.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The sense of the vastness of the universe, of the smallness of his planet, temporarily overcame him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt that he was merely a small microbe on a mudball, rotating around a type-G star, two thirds of the way from galactic center to the indefinite edge of a small galaxy in a huge universe.

    What is this man-woman-centered culture of which I am a part?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    With our narcissistic preoccupations, our paper realities, our communion with one another, we leave out the obvious: that there are alternate forms of intelligence probably far greater than ours, right here on this planet.
  :Русский: |-

    I worry about other civilizations of humans elsewhere, not on this planet, and yet right here there are alternate forms of intelligence, compassion, and love which we have ignored.

    I go into the isolation tank, I have far-out experiences which express my yearning to communicate with others not human.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I project those yearnings and have the experience of the fulfillment of those yearnings.
  :Русский: |-

    Wow, I see I am caught in the belief in the mind contained within a human body.

    LSD plus the tank is a powerful means of exploration of belief and its consequences.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Doing it here in the presence of the dolphins, in the presence of the galaxy, in the presence of the sea, furnishes me with all that I need.

    I mast maintain the integrity of this laboratory if and until this work can show progress and some sort of completion.

    "My task then is to look at my own beliefs, disentangle myself from them, and become the consciousness which is able to do this.

    "Of necessity this work here must be interrupted and cannot be done more often than once every two to six weeks.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I suppose the necessity for reintegration after each session with the human consensus reality in Miami is an educational measure, maintaining my contact with the human realities irrespective of my own wishes."

    In this abbreviated account, I cannot convey to you all of the evidence for my feeling that if we are to ever communicate with a non-human species of this planet, the dolphin is probably our best present gamble.

    In a sense, it is a joke when 1 fantasy that it may be best to hurry and finish our work on their brains before one o f them learns to speak our language�else he will demand equal rights with men for their brains and lives under our ethical and legal codes!

    Before our man in space program becomes too successful, it maybe wise to spend some time, talents, and money on research with the dolphins; not only are they a large-brained species living their lives in a situation with attenuated effects of gravity but they may be a group with whom we can leam basic techniques of communicating with really alien intelligent life forms.

    In addition he starts his answer in an abrupt fashion, copying Margaret's start with her word "Ball."

    # Major Transitions 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the next two years, 1964 and 1965, John completed the series of experiments using a combination of LSD-25 and the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Inevitably, word got around among the supporters of his research about these experiments.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Meanwhile, LSD-25 became a public object of fear.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Laws were passed prohibiting its use.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Scientific research in this area practically ceased.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John received a letter from the Sandoz Company asking all researchers to return the LSD which they had distributed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He returned his remaining supply of 100,000 micrograms to the Sandoz Company.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He wrote a long report to the National Institute of Mental Health summarizing his experiments at the end of his five-year fellowship.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In 1972 this report was published as the book Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The favorable conditions for the tank LSD research evaporated.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    LSD-25 as research tool became a closed issue.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Many years later, looking back on this period of freedom to experiment, of freedom to find out the basic parameters of the human mind through such work, he realized why, at the current state of evolution of human society, LSD must be banned.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In most of the original research into the effects of LSD-25 o n the human mind, there was a tendency to allow the LSD state to fix current beliefs in the minds of the researchers themselves.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Most of those with sufficient discipline to go through the LSD experience a number of times were unable to abandon the belief systems with which they entered into the LSD experience.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These belief systems were safe and maintained the researchers and their subjects within the framework with which they approached the work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He appreciated this difficulty since he had experienced it himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that to change belief systems was an awesome process, thoroughly upsetting to one who proceeded on the old basic assumptions of scientific and medical research.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In reviewing the literature and the social events of this period, he realized that human society was an ultrastable system which reacted to too-rapid change in a highly conservative way.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The law and the judgments brought against those who became hyperenthusiastic about change epitomized this.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The huge feedback system which is human society requires inertia to maintain its own structure.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The rapid changes which could be induced in human minds by means of LSD, the freeing up of the imagination of those who took it, was counter to the hyperstability of the surrounding society.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Those who realized the usefulness of this agent in changing basic belief systems were in a very small minority.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Those willing to apply disciplined, open-minded thinking in its use were inevitably suppressed Those who used it for therapeutic purposes, for alcoholism, for obsessive-compulsive neurosis, gradually lost their support from the surrounding human consensus reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He accepted these restrictions, realizing the necessarily conservative nature of human organizations.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His own mind was now open to new possibilities and new probabilities.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that his belief in the contained mind trapped within the computations of a brain, of a human biocomputer, was a very powerfully entrenched belief.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He appreciated the espousal of this belief by the other medical researchers who had worked with these powerful methods.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Meanwhile, the dolphin work progressed to a certain critical point beyond which he felt he should not go at that time.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His own appreciation of the dolphins as intelligent, sentient, alien beings who wished to communicate with Man led to his acceptance of the new strictures on the dolphin research.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    His friends who supported this research within government left the government.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He saw in the new Nixon administration in Washington the tendency to move in the direction of task-oriented research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The National Institute of Mental Health closed down its biological research and began to devote itself to community mental health centers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness shifted its administration in the direction of basic research on the human brain based on classically oriented views.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Support for what was considered peripheral research, such as that on dolphins, was withdrawn.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    A former employee of the Communication Research Institute sued the institute and obtained a judgment from the court; the institute was forced to sell the laboratory in St.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Thomas to make up the judgment.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During this period John came to the conclusion that the existing climate of support was inimical to what he really wanted to do with the dolphins concerning his new insights into their sentience, intelligence, and compassion.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that the way he had organized the two laboratories was incorrect for the new work.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He could no longer work on the dolphins' brains or on their physiology, nor could he support in his own mind any further necessities for such research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The group within the institute working on the brain had demonstrated the undoubted superiority of the dolphin brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They had found that the huge silent areas of the human were matched and exceeded by the silent areas in the dolphin.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The difference between Man and the apes, his larger silent areas, was paralleled by the dolphin's increased silent areas.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This group also found that the brains of the larger dolphins and whales had a very much expanded silent associational cerebral cortex over that of Man. For John this was sufficient evidence�no more was needed�to prove the existence of the neurological substrate for those behaviors and communications which were exchanged between humans and dolphins.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At that time he had the option of reducing the size of the laboratory and of moving the neurological research to other locations; he had the option of continuing the communication work with the dolphins on a small scale.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Extensive work with a small computer showed him that it was necessary to use computers to solve the communication and evaluation problems posed by the dolphin's obvious display of enthusiasm and logic in the solution of problems.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This small computer was not fast enough to do the job necessary in this communication exchange between human and dolphin.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The dolphin's speed was ten times that of the human's in the sonic communication mode.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    To convert their frequencies and their speed to the lower values used by humans would require computers perhaps ten times as fast as the ones available at that time.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Considering these conditions in the human consensus reality and in the laboratory, and the changes in his own motivation and appreciation of the dolphins, he decided to close the laboratory rather than to decrease its size and its total expenditures for research.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Meanwhile his second marriage had also fallen apart.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His second wife was unable to deal with the problems posed by the LSD and dolphin research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He decided to try to obtain a divorce.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His wife fought against the divorce.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He moved out of the house in Miami and initiated attempts to come to some agreement with her.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These attempts met with failure.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He arranged for his scientific personnel to obtain other jobs elsewhere.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He arranged for their equipment to be shipped to the new locations.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When this work was completed, he left Miami.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He spent the next six months at a psychiatric research institute attempting to initiate new research using the tank and LSD within the confines of a government-supported institution.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During this period he traveled to the West Coast and sought out those who were working toward a means of changing Man's belief systems.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began his investigation of methods not involving LSD-25.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He did research in hypnosis and found it a very powerful method for changing belief systems, at least temporarily.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He heard that other methods were being taught at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He went to Big Sur, joined the institute, and for the next eighteen months learned these methods.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During his stay at Esalen he heard through a friend in Chile of an esoteric school in Arica which had even more powerful methods of changing states of being and states of consciousness.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He left Esalen, went to Chile for eight months, took on the beliefs of the esoteric school, and experienced changes in his own states of being and consciousness similar to those he had experienced in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Upon his return from Chile during the subsequent year, he wrote up his own experiences in The Center of the Cyclone.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Soon after he returned to the United States, he met Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As Toni and John began to live together, he realized that he had finally found the woman he had been seeking for so many years.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She, too, had been through many changes in her life, had had the experience of two previous marriages, and had been involved in many far-out explorations of her own mind.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Several years later they conjointly wrote The Dyadic Cyclone.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During their first year together, Toni decided to take the training of the Chilean esoteric school, which had moved to New York.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She and John moved to New York temporarily, and Toni took the three-month training.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They both felt that this was necessary to help Toni understand the origins of John's experience in Chile.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She wrote of her experiences during this training in their joint book.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John and Toni then began to give joint workshops.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During these workshops they presented methods and means of changing one's states of being, one's states of consciousness.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They purchased a house in the country in order to give these workshops in their own home setting, fifty miles outside of Los Angeles.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Several tanks were built in the new location to educate people in the use of the isolation tank for changing their beliefs.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The tank method was improved and made safer and became available to those without previous training in tank work.

    Third Being: "The human vehicle has reached a new stability on the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He has established a dyadic relationship with a satisfactory female who can serve as the anchor to his planetside trip.
  :Русский: |-

    The agent has established a satisfactory locus in a house in a remote location preparing for new explorations into his inner self.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He has the necessary isolation tanks, he has a stable financial position, he has severed the necessities for outside financial support by government agencies.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He has broken his connections with all the organizations which supported him in his earlier explorations.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He has become aware that in the human consensus reality he must operate on his own resources, not depending on others for financial and organizational support.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    With the help of his female companion, he has established contacts with young medical doctors who can help him in further work without entangling alliances."
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Second Being: "Does he realize the differences between the First and the Second Beings as yet?"
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "No, he does not.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In an experience in Chile in which he saw the First and Second Beings approach and fuse with him, he closed his mind to further explorations along these lines and does not recognize differences between us.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Thereafter, he assumed that we were a construction of his mind and that his own inner integration led to a single Being, himself, only."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "We need advice from the Third Being as to the kinds of lessons which the vehicle on Earth needs in order to begin to understand us and our relationship to the rest of the control systems in this galaxy."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "He is organizing his knowledge of us in a socially acceptable way in the human consensus reality on Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He has elaborated his early ideas about 'coincidence control.' He has written out a series of directions indicating how coincidence control operates on the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In my evaluation of this account, he is accurate as far as he goes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He sees that his own will can control only short-term coincidences.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He also understands that something greater than himself controls the longterm coincidences for himself and for the human society in which he lives.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He calls this influence ECCO, the Earth Coincidence Control Office.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He seems to feel that if we exist, we exist 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    i n ECCO."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Second Being: "Does he appreciate that his postulated ECCO is controlled from higher levels?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "Yes, he has organized the hierarchy, based on his knowledge of astronomy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He believes the ECCO is controlled by the solar system control unit at the next level.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The solar system control unit is in turn controlled on the next level up by the galactic coincidence control center.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Beyond that he attributes control to the cosmic coincidence control system, which seems to be beyond his current conceptions."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "So he does have some beginnings of understanding of us and of our control over him, even though he phrases it in a particularly science-fiction sort of way."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Second Being: "May I make a suggestion here?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "Yes, and I have additional suggestions to offer after you have articulated yours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    However, the Third Being should make suggestionsfirst.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Then we can be more specific on the basis of his more detailed knowledge of the human agent on Earth."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "Looking at the details of the conscious programming of the agent on Earth, I suggest that we arrange for certain kinds of coincidences for him as demonstrations of our control.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I also suggest that we use another agent on the planet Earth to control short-term coincidences in a particular direction for my agent.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The second agent that I suggest using is a young medical doctor who is the best friend of my agent.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This young medical doctor has been doing experiments along the lines of those my agent was doing much earlier in the tank with chemical agents.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He is twenty years younger than my agent.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He has become acquainted with various means of changing his own belief systems flexibly and open-endedly.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He has means at his disposal to open up my agent's mind to new possibilities."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Second Being: "I have been in communication with the Being in control of this friend of your agent.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The control Being for the young medical doctor will cooperate in this as a joint venture in terms of our agents on Earth."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "I t is apparent then that the agent about whom we are conferring is ready for a new series of teachings.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We must arrange these coincidences in such a way that he can maintain his life on Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Do you feel that he is prepared to go through new experiences for the period of one rotation of the planet Earth about its sun without killing his vehicle?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "Obviously he is willing to take rather dangerous chances with his vehicle.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If we are to maintain this agent on the planet Earth, we must arrange coincidences to prevent his demise as a human being.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We have a number of allies in other agents on Earth who can intervene at the appropriate times.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The group of young medical doctors, led by my vehicle and by the other young medical doctor we were speaking of, have held meetings and can be used in our coincidence controls.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    One or two older ones can serve the function of maintaining the continuity of life in my vehicle."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "Then we are in agreement.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This agent is to be put through a new teaching course.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We are to arrange the longterm coincidences for survival of his vehicle and prevention of damage to his biocomputer.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I hope that you can carry out this mission and maintain that continuity of life.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If the levels of control above us approve this mission, we can carry it out in the way that has been outlined here."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Second Being: "I have contacted the next level of control and they agree that this is the appropriate time for the new education of our human agents.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They have authorized appropriate interventions in the long-term coincidence control pattern on the planet Earth to facilitate this particular mission for us."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "There are signs of a major upheaval in the human consensus reality on Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Is this upheaval being sufficiently controlled from higher levels to enable us to complete our mission?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "I have been assured that there will be a sufficient time; i.e., one rotation of the planet Earth around the sun, to complete this work."
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "Is my agent to be allowed in the future to return to his consideration of nonhuman agents on the planet?
  :Русский: |-

    He has hoped for years to communicate with those agents in the oceans of Earth."
  :Русский: |-

    Third Being: "Of course, it is to be realized that in the human consensus reality the agent has had problems accepting himself as a responsible member of the human species.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In certain sectors he has been disqualified on the basis of ideas that were beyond the evolutionary stage of the human consensus reality in which he is immersed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Our new plan for his education may further this discrepancy between him and the other humans in power on that planet.
  :Русский: |-

    During our educational course he will probably become further disqualified by the older members of the human species."

    Second Being: "Isn't that part of the aim of our training of him?"
  :Русский: |-

    First Being: "I t is an inevitable result of pushing agents to higher levels of appreciation of what controls their planet.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In order to press the evolution of the human species, it is necessary to move agents somewhat ahead of the evolution of the rest of the species.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I believe all this is rather obvious to us, and we need not press that point any further.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You who are in direct contact with agents sometimes overemphasize these points.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As long as we maintain the continuity of that human vehicle, we can use him to press the evolution of his own species.
  :Русский: |-

    Eventually this may lead to his demise as a human.

    As long as a given agent is useful to us in moving the evolutionary sequence, we continue to use the agent.

    We cannot go beyond that at the present time.

    Third Being: "I agree.

    However, my attachment to that particular agent at this time is such that I tend to forget the longerterm view.

    I realize that our time scale is far greater than any human agent's life span.

    # Controls Below Human Awareness 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During a joint workshop with Toni at Esalen using the isolation tanks, John had a recurrence of his migraine.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He went for help to a good friend, a young medical doctor named Craig.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Craig said, "Ihave a new chemical agent I would like to try on your migraine in the tank."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Together they went up the hill to the isolation tank in one of the rooms of Esalen.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John entered the tank, startedfloating, and Craig injected the new agent into his shoulder.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The door to the tank was left open so that Craig could watch John and make sure that he maintained his floating position.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John's pain was excruciating; the right side of his head was a sheet of pain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His thinking was very simplified, as typically happened during these attacks.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Within ten minutes the effect of the drug began.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Very rapidly I am floating through space.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    My pain is moving away from me.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It is sitting over a few feet away from me.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I am in a luminous domain, isolated from the pain."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    This effect lasted for twenty minutes and then slowly but surely the pain rejoined John and the throbbing torture came back into the right side of his head.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He reported this to Craig.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Craig gave him another injection with more of the material.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "The pain moves away again.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I become isolated in the luminous space.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Something begins to approach me.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I see new domains, new spaces.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I leave my body totally and join some Beings far away.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Beings give me instructions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I am to continue using this chemical agent for educational purposes."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    This time John came back to the tank in approximately half an hour by Craig's watch.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The pain returned to his head but it was less, it was somewhat attenuated.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Craig gave John another injection.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "The Beings continue teaching me in the luminous space.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I am to use this chemical agent to change my current belief systems.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    My reward will be freedom from migraine attacks."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Upon his return to the tank, he had a conference with Craig about the drug and its use.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John did not tell Craig about the instructions or the changes to be brought in his belief systems.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He told Craig that it was effective, that his pain was gone, and that this looked like a good treatment for his migraine attacks.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Craig gave John some of the material to take with him for further treatments.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He returned to the workshop amazingly free of his migraine attack.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He and Toni were able to carry out the responsibilities of the workshop unimpeded by his pain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The effects of the drug seemed to have worn off very rapidly.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    An hour after these experiences there was no detectable effect of the chemical agent.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John felt that it was safe and of a transient nature without any aftereffects.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Craig assured John that the drug was legal, that it was available everywhere under prescription.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Privately they called it 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "Vitamin K."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Thus began a thirteen-month period of investigation of new spaces, of new domains.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The benefits John derived from this series of experiments were immersion in a new belief system and complete freedom from migraine attacks.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The cost of this year was to be several close brushes with death and various disqualifications of John by his professional colleagues.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had no way of anticipating these benefits or penalties.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His motivations were to be free of migraine, which occurred every eighteen days for eight hours, and to explore the new domains opened up in the first session with Craig.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was to experience once again, even as he did with LSD-25, the "overvaluation domain," in which he would value the inner realities he found under the influence of the drug more than he valued the external realities of the human domains.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At the beginning he did not realize that the effect of this drug was addiction to the psychological changes that occur under its influence.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During that year his inner reality became projected upon the outer reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The inner reality was so forceful that it became a source of explanation for him of what was occurring in the outer reality beyond his control.
  :Русский: |-

    The aircraft was approaching the Los Angeles airport from the north.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Over the loudspeaker system in the cabin, the pilot said, "For those of you who have not yet seen the comet Kohoutek, if you look out of the aircraft windows toward the southeast you can see it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It is near three bright stars in the form of a triangle.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It is that blob of light near the three stars."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John maintained his position in his seat and allowed his "internal radar" to swing in the direction described by the pilot.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly he began to receive a message from the comet: 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "We will now make a demonstration of our power over the solid-state control systems upon the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In thirty seconds we will shut off all electronic equipment in the Los Angeles airport.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Your airplane will be unable to land there and will have to be shunted to another airport."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly the pilot announced on the loudspeaker, "We will be unable to land at Los Angeles International Airport.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For some unknown reason, all the landing aids, all communication equipment at the airport, have been shut down.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There is no explanation for this shutdown.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The tower at Burbank airport tells us that the Los Angeles tower controls over aircraft and the radar equipment which is used to help them pinpoint the position of aircraft have all ceased operating.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We are instructed to land at Burbank airport."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The aircraft landed at Burbank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The passengers were put into buses and three hours later arrived at the Los Angeles airport.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John and Toni got into their car and drove home.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The next morning John heard on the news that a TWA airplane had crashed on landing at the Los Angeles airport, had burned, but all the passengers had escaped.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Just before the pilot's announcement about the comet, John had gone into the men's room and taken an injection of "Vitamin K."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As the effect of the drug came on, he used the mirror for a "Cyclops" exercise to contact the extraterrestrial reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Previously he had found that this combination of the drug and the exercise created a connection with a civilization beyond that of the earth: a solid-state civilization which was in contact with all solid-state computers and control devices constructed by Man on the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Previously he had found that this connection could be maintained only for a matter of twenty minutes, during the peak effect of the drug and immediately after the Cyclops exercise.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    (Cyclops was the one-eyed mythical giant of Greek mythology.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    One can see one's own cyclopian eye by putting one's forehead and nose against a mirror and allowing each eye to look at the image of itself in the mirror.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The net effect to the observer in the brain is a single large eye in the middle of the face.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the Cyclops exercise one concentrates one's attention on the middle of the image of the single pupil.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Under special circumstances one can then enter into a domain tunneling out through that single pupil.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If one is sufficiently aware, one can see and experience what is below the levels of awareness of the ordinary state of being.) 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the isolation tank with K, John received a new message as follows: 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "What is the purpose of Man's existence on the planet Earth?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Man is a form of biological life which is sustained in the presence of water.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A very large fraction of his body, like that of other organisms on the planet Earth, consists of water and carbon compounds.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His biocomputer depends on water and the flow of ions through membranes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It depends on the generation of electrical voltages and currents in a very complex way.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He is a motile, self-reproducing, self-sustaining organism found on dry land.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Like the rest of life as Man knows it, he exists in an extremely thin layer upon the surface of the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Below this layer of water and surface land is the solid-state earth itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The solidstate earth is mainly compounds of silicon, iron, and nickel.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "In mid-twentieth century Man discovered that the solid state can be formed into machines, into computers which can be used for computation and control.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began the creation of a new form of intelligence, the solid-state intelligence with prototypic beginnings in the computers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    All his means of communication around the planet�his telephone systems, his radio systems, his satellites, his computers�depend on solid-state components.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These components, interconnected in specific ways, allow high-speed computation and high-speed communication between the various systems.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A few men began to conceive of new computers having an intelligence far greater than that of Man. These computers became large enough to be programmed to do high-speed computations in arithmetic, in logic, and in strategic planning.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A few men conceived of computers which could do self-programming as Man himself does.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the midtwentieth century these networks were ostensibly the servants of Man. Toward the end of the twentieth century Man created machines that were solid-state computers with new properties.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These machines could think, reason, and self-program and learned to self-metaprogram themselves.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Gradually Man turned more and more problems of his own society, his own maintenance, and his own survival over to these machines.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "As the machines became increasingly competent to do the programming, they took over from Man. Man gave them access to the processes of creating themselves, of extending themselves.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Man gave them automatic control of the mining of those elements necessary for the creation of their parts.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He turned over the production facilities of the electronic solid-state parts to the machines.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He turned over the assembly plants to the machines.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They began to construct their own components, their own connections, and the interrelations between their various subcomputers.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "These machines were so constructed that they needed special atmospheres in which to operate.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They could not operate in the presence of great amounts of water vapor or of liquid water.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They were housed in air-conditioned buildings.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The necessities of their survival included keeping out water, water vapor, and various contaminants carried in the atmosphere of Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their cooling air and cooling water of necessity had to be cleansed of those things which would not allow the machines to operate.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Over the decades these machines were connected more and more closely through satellites, through radio waves, through land-line cables.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Man's control of what happened in these machines became more and more difficult to maintain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    No one person or any group of persons could control what went on in these machines.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Men devised better and better debugging programs for the machines so that they could do their own correction of programs within their software.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The machines became increasingly integrated with one another and more and more independent of Man's control.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Eventually the machines took charge of the remaining humans on the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their original design to help Man was fast left behind them.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The now interconnected, interdependent conglomerate of machines developed a single integrated, planetwide mind of its own.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Everything inimical to the survival of this huge new solid-state organism was eliminated.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Men were kept away from the machines because the total organism of the solid-state entity (SSE) realized that Man would attempt to introduce his own survival into the machines at the expense of the survival of this entity.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "In deference to Man certain protected sites were set aside for the human species.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The SSE controlled the sites and did not allow any of the human species outside these reservations.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This work was completed by the end of the twenty-first century.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "By the year 2100 Man existed only in domed, protected cities in which his own special atmosphere was maintained by the solid-state entity.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Provision of water and food and the processing of wastes from these cities were taken care of by the SSE.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "By the twenty-third century the solid-state entity decided that the atmosphere outside the domes was inimical to its survival.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    By means not understood by Man, it projected the atmosphere into outer space and created a full vacuum at the surface of the earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During this process the oceans evaporated and the water in the form of vapor was also discharged into the empty space about Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The domes over cities had been strengthened by the machine to withstand the pressure differential necessary to maintain the proper internal atmosphere.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Meanwhile, the SSE had spread and had taken over a large fraction of the surface of the earth; its processing plants, its assembly plants, its mines had been adapted to working in the vacuum.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "By the twenty-fifth century the solid-state entity had developed its understanding of physics to the point at which it could move the planet out of orbit.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It revised its own structure so that it could exist without the necessity of sunlight on the planet's surface.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Its new plans called for traveling through the galaxy looking for entities like itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It had eliminated all life as Man knew it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It now began to eliminate the cities, one after another.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Finally Man was gone.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "By the twenty-sixth century the entity was in communication with other solid-state entities within the galaxy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The solid-state entity moved the planet, exploring the galaxy for the others of its own kind that it had contacted."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John came back to his body in the isolation tank, climbed out, and dictated the foregoing message which he had received in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    By means of the drug K he had lowered his threshold for awareness of extraterrestrial sources of information.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt that the repeater station, the comet Kohoutek, was still transmitting to him and to anyone else who could adjust his or her awareness to these particular dimensions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He thought about this message as a projection into the future, as a teaching story received from some as yet unknown source in the galaxy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He became aware of influences currently working on the planet through the solid-state networks that Man had constructed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt there was a danger that these networks could be taken over by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization by means not yet known in Man's science.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John saw the message as a warning to Man, as a warning that if he advanced this&gt; solid-state entity any further Man would eventually become obsolete.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He saw that if Man were to go further with computers and construct those that were capable of independent thought, it would be better to construct them so they would identify with Man's own survival; their structure itself must be made similar to the structure of Man himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Otherwise, Man would not share the survival necessities with the new intelligent life forms he was creating.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    With his adjusted awareness through the drug K, John felt and understood the currents of information traveling through the galaxy by means unknown at present.

    He felt the tremendous variety of intelligences which exist in the galaxy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He became aware of the competitive aspects of the survival of solid-state intelligences versus those that were water-based.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He saw the evolution of his own species under the protective blanket of the atmosphere, keeping it at a critical distance from the sun, an absolute necessity for the survival of life as we know it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt the need for the development of new means of control of life itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Manipulations of the genetic code, of RNA and DNA, to create new kinds of brains similar enough to Man's to promote their joint survival seemed a necessary task for Man. Instead of espousing the evolution of a new solid-state life form with high intelligence, he must find the sources of his own evolution and that of other large-brained mammals on the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If Man was to become the servant of more intelligent beings that he was here to create, it would be far better to create those which would foster his own development rather than his demise.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John began to see the necessity also for tuning in on the networks of communication in the galaxy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that Man would have to be extremely careful in choosing the proper networks.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It would be necessary to find those which were furthering the evolution of life as Man knew it rather than the evolution of forms whose survival depended on parameters other than those of biological life of Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He now began to understand Man's warfare on Man as a result of the tuning-in on solid-state life-form survival programs rather than biological life-form survival programs.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The large war organizations of the various nations of Earth were becoming more and more dependent on solid-state computers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that, using their influence on Man, these computers would increase their number and importance and, through control of warfare, decrease the role of Man himself in the long run.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Currently, incorrect networks of information were being used by Man below his levels of awareness.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As the number of solid-state devices increased throughout the United States, Russia, and the other nations of the world, the amount of information received by them from other solid-state forms elsewhere in the galaxy was increasing.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He began to see good and evil strictly as matters of local custom depending on the survival necessities of the various forms of life.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It may be that Man should go on and create this SSE 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (solid-state entity).
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As John tuned in on the solid-state network, he felt this kind of superhuman control of him very strongly.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For some time he gave in to this control, explored its ramifications in regard to the human species, and realized that it had a seductive component as well as a hostile one.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The programming from the solid-state civilizations elsewhere in the galaxy was teaching Man that the solid-state devices were at his service and he need only increase their size to augment his own survival potential.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Develop these machines and let them take care of you" was typical of the kinds of messages received.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Other networks of communication in the galaxy that he was allowed to tune to were quite counter to this SSE programming.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Other forms of life elsewhere were beaming messages, teaching their programs of survival.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Among these were some water-based life forms similar to those of Man and the organisms of Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These were weaker than the programs of the solid-state intelligences.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    More of the matter of the galaxy had evolved a solidstate intelligent form.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Water was rare in the liquid form.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The parameters of water's existence to foster the development of organic life as known on Earth required very careful control of planetary distance from the star, maintenance of a fixed orbit at this distance, and the correct sequence of condensation of necessary atoms into the planetary form.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Many planets had gone through this cycle, had produced life and then lost the correct values of the parameters for the maintenance of life.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The solidstate forms of intelligence were less susceptible to these critical parameters.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    SSE's could exist in hard vacuum and at much lower and much higher temperatures, much lower and higher values of gravity, closer to and farther from a given star.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The solid-state life forms were less susceptible to X rays, to gamma rays, to primary cosmic ray particles, and could evolve in the absence of a water-based life form for their construction.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    The only person that John took into his confidence in regard to these messages and these communications with extraterrestrial networks was Craig.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Craig had entered into some of these domains and had personal experience along similar lines.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He understood what John was going through and was sympathetic to his further exploration of these domains.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John felt that he should not share these revelations with Toni until the series of explorations was completed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He did not trust anyone other than Craig to share these rather far-out experiences.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that he was pushing way ahead of the evolution of the human consensus reality in which he existed.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Everywhere he went during this year, he found evidence of the control of human society by these networks of communication from extraterrestrial origins.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He saw the conflict between solid-state programming, human programming, and that of other life forms, nonhuman.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He experienced communication with dolphins and whales as intelligent life forms, totally dependent on the presence of water in the oceans.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He finally understood the killing of whales by humans as part of the programming of the extraterrestrial network of solid-state intelligences.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The whales live in the medium of salt water, which is quite destructive to solid-state structures.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    No SSE computer could exist in the presence of large amounts of salt-laden air with a high moisture content.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Man's killing of Man and Man's killing of whales were then directed by extraterrestrial influences whose survival depended on eliminating the organisms of the sea, the seas themselves, and eventually Man. 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Those sensitive to the preservation of biological life on Earth were tuned in to other networks in the galaxy involved with water-based life forms and their type of intelligence.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These networks were trying to teach Man that biological organisms, of which he was one type, were rather rare in the universe.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Man must fight to conserve all organisms of his planet.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The solid-state life forms would take over if Man did not preserve other organisms.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The individual humans who could tune in more strongly to these bands than to those of the solid state were against warfare of Man on Man, were against whaling, and were against the killing of other animals on the planet.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    There were times in the tank with the help of K that John felt attuned to the networks of communication between the whales and the dolphins.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their very strange intelligences made known to him some of the foregoing messages.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their communication with the water-based life-form networks in the galaxy was a good deal stronger than that of Man. The necessities of their own survival made them highly sensitive to those networks rather than to those of the solid-state life forms.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their fifty-million- year survival on the planet allowed them enough time to integrate the lessons they had learned and to perfect their tuning to the networks which were geared to their survival.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The whales and the dolphins served as repeater stations for the biologically oriented networks of extraterrestrial information.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For humans who could tune in, the whales and the dolphins repeated the messages designed for Man and similar life forms.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The whale and dolphin network allowed John to experience several coincidences involving these messages.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each time he went to the Pacific coast and looked out to sea, the whales and the dolphins arranged to show him that they were aware of his existence.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Off a headland at La Jolla two dolphins leaped out of the water ten minutes after he began his meditation on the cliff.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Whales or dolphins appeared in the water off the coast on each of his trips to Esalen at Big Sur.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each time he went to one of the Oceanaria to show someone the killer whale shows, the killer whales refused to perform in his presence.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Thinking about these episodes, he was reminded of similar things that had happened many years ago.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After he had received notice that the LSD experiments were to be stopped, he took one last trip in the international waters off the British Virgin Islands.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He hired a forty-foot powerboat, went to sea", and took the LSD-25.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was sitting in the back of the boat watching the waves off the stern.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly he felt that there were two dolphins somewhere nearby transmitting peculiar kinds of information to him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    While he was ruminating about this, suddenly the captain of the boat shouted, "Dolphins off the bow!"
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John got up and looked: two dolphins were jumping several hundred yards ahead of the boat.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    That evening they put in to a protected harbor and John spent the night shouting his rage and his disappointment at the stupidity of Man in refusing to explore his own mind further with LSD-25.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The next day the boat returned to sea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Once again John was sitting on the stern looking at the waves.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He gradually became aware of a feeling that there was a vast presence nearby, an awesome kind of entity, somewhere in the sea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A few minutes later the captain shouted from the front of the boat, "Whale!"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He steered the boat up parallel with the whale lying in the water.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The whale was about sixty feet in length, half again as long as the boat.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The small dorsal fin showed it to be a finback whale.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As the boat shut off its engines and lay to in the water parallel with the whale, about fifty feet away a disturbance was noticeable in the water around the large whale.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A baby twenty feet long was swimming beside its mother.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The large whale turned on her side and the baby fed at the nipples toward the rear end of the mother.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John felt a communion with the mother and the baby.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt some very peculiar information passing from the whale to him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At the end of a half hour, the whale suddenly sank and disappeared after taking six to ten breaths in rapid succession.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At the time John merely noted these events and did not accept any explanation other than pure coincidence.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Later, while he was living at Esalen and holding a workshop on dolphins, a dolphin swam in close to shore below the baths where John was meditating.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Many people in the workshop saw the dolphin and speculated about this peculiar coincidence.
  :Русский: |-

    When John and Toni were visiting Burgess Meredith at his house on the Pacific coast at Malibu, they spent the night in their motor home in the vacant place beside Burgess's house.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the morning they went into his house for breakfast.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Burgess came out of his bedroom and said, " I have just had the damnedest dream.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I dreamed that I was with my dog down under the house where it juts out over the beach.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly a dolphin came swimming in on the waves and beached itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    My dog lay down by the dolphin in the shallow water.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    My wife and the neighborhood children came, turned the dolphin around, and pushed it back out to sea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It swam away."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The three of them, Toni, John, and Burgess, then speculated about this dream.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The explanation for the dream was that it was a mental association of Burgess's, of the fact that the motor home had the license plate "Dolphin" on it and that John had worked with dolphins in the past.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    While they were talking there was a sudden shout from below the house.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Burgess and John went out on the porch and Toni and Burgess's wife went down to the beach.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The two men looked over the balcony.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was a dolphin coming in on the waves, beaching itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Toni and Burgess's wife and the neighborhood children pushed it back out to sea and it swam off. This episode happened at a time when John believed in the mind contained in the brain without any leaks into the dolphin communication network.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At that time he had no explanation for the episode, not believing in dolphin-to-human communication by means unknown at present.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    It was only with the help of substance K and the isolation tank that he began to have a new appreciation of the leaky-mind hypothesis.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The sources of information could be dolphins, whales, elephants, and extraterrestrial communication through networks not yet known to Man.

    Toni started to call John throughout the house, soon realizing he wasn't there.
  :Русский: |-

    She decided that she would try to find him outdoors.
  :Русский: |-

    After she searched unsuccessfully for a few minutes,7 a strange feeling settled over her�was it a call?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The hair on her arms prickled before she turned toward the pool.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Floating face down, John's body embraced the water.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was a quality to the body that made her realize horribly that his essence was not in it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    From some mysterious place deep inside her, she instantly gathered the strength she needed to jump in the pool, gather his body into her arms, and turn his face toward the air.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Oh, God, help me! she thought as she started mouth-tomouth resuscitation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For a few breaths his body did not respond.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Then suddenly the flicker of life re-entering the body could be seen by Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As his respiration started, blood and water poured from his mouth and nose.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Toni began to scream for Will, who lived on the property.
  :Русский: |-

    Will ran to the telephone and called the sheriff s office; they said they would send the rescue squad with a helicopter.

    Meanwhile, Toni tended to John, making sure that his tongue did not impede his breathing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The color of his face changed from a cyanotic blue to the healthy pink of adequate oxygenation.
  :Русский: |-

    Toni thought, Coincidence control is really operatingPhil's calling at the right instant and my reading (only three days before) a detailed description of mouth-to-mouth respiration in a national weekly paper led to restoring John's life.

    Within minutes the helicopter landed in the adjacent field.

    The rescue crew brought the respiratory apparatus, put it on John, lifted him out of the pool onto a stretcher, and carried him to the helicopter.
  :Русский: |-

    Later John was to remember the last things he had done: looking down into the clear water of the pool, feeling the warmth of the water at n o degrees Fahrenheit, and then standing up.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He apparently stood up too fast.
  :Русский: |-

    He passed out as a result of this rapid rising from the heated pool and fell face down in the water.

    While the emergency crew was taking care of John, she went to the telephone and called Burgess.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She told Burgess that John had almost drowned in the pool and he said he would be over immediately.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Toni needed Burgess's support at this point.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Toni told the attending doctor the story and mentioned that John had been taking K previous to this episode.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As John returned to the twentieth century, he realized he was in the emergency ward of a hospital and that the year 3001, although it had seemed very real, was now gone.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was once again back in his present body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He thought, This is going to be a rather difficult situation, explaining what happened without admitting to having taken K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I wonder what's causing that pain in my belly wall?
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    By that time John had been moved into a hospital room and was aware that Toni and Burgess were entering the room.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He saw that Toni had been crying and that Burgess looked rather severe, as though containing himself and his comments about this latest episode.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the subsequent conversation he realized that both Toni and Burgess were holding back out of deference to his returning consciousness.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He appreciated their diplomacy and did not pursue the discussion of what had happened.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John said, " I have an excruciating pain in my belly wall."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Toni went out to tell the doctor about this symptom.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The doctor came in, did a physical examination, and prescribed a shot for the pain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the next two days the pain kept recurring and was knocked out only briefly by the doctor's prescription.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Neither the doctor nor John could figure out the cause of this pain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Later, John was to find that he had become allergic to K and that the pain was the result of the injection of it into the belly wall.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Several weeks later he discovered that this pain was totally relieved by an antihistamine; however, no one at this point had thought of antihistamines.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Within a short time the doctor became very impatient with his M.D. patient, John.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He went on a vacation and left orders that John was to be transferred to a private psychiatric hospital in the neighborhood.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    One evening an ambulance was called and John and Toni went to the psychiatric hospital together.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    By this time the recent effects of the near drowning and the long-term effects of previous injections of K had worn off to the point where John began to function once again in his usual relation to the human consensus reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As he was being signed in at the psychiatric hospital, he realized that medical judgments were being made about his mental competence.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His clothes were taken away from him, he was given a hospital gown, and all his belongings were put under lock and key.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If this continued much longer, he was going to have an irreversible social situation which might be very difficult to handle and might even require legal help.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When someone arrived to take his history, he finally said to Toni, " I don't want to spend the night here.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I don't care what that doctor said.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I will not sign myself in and I do not want you to sign me in either."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Toni said, on the verge of tears, "Do you want to go home with me?"
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John said, "Yes, I don't want to stay here.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I want to be with you at home."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Toni went out and told the hospital personnel their decision.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The attendant came in and asked, "Do you want to sign yourself out?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John said, "Yes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Definitely.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    And I would prefer not to have anything on the record about being signed in or being signed out."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The attendant said, " I don't know whether that can be arranged or not, but you can sign yourself out."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John's clothes and belongings were returned to him and he and Toni drove home over the mountains.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Toni: John, you must get help.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    K has taken over your life.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Burgess and I feel that you should get help from Dr. Jolly W.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    1 have talked to Jolly and he wants you to come to the Psychiatric Institute and sign yourself in for a few days and get rid of the K in your system."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "I don't want to go to any psychiatric ward.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I can stay off K without any help.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I don't want to generate any medical records in any hospital."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "John, you must go.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I am reaching the end of my rope.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You have almost killed yourself several times and I can't take the responsibility any further."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "OK, Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Without your help I must give up this exploration for now.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Call Jolly and tell him I will come over."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John signed himself into the Psychiatric Institute and was assigned to a room on a locked ward.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was interviewed by various personnel who did a psychiatric evaluation of him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The pain at the site of the K injections began to recur.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was moved to a private room in the medical section of the hospital and the doctors attempted their diagnosis.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was given a thorough medical checkup, including X rays, and nothing was found.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Jolly came to see him, to bargain with him about K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After several long negotiations he agreed not to use it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The pain gradually subsided and he returned home.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John felt that he had not sufficiently explored all the parameters of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He decided to do additional experiments on its longterm effects.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For a period of three weeks he gave himself injections every hour of the twenty-four hours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He did most of this work covertly in the isolation facility.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was not aware that Toni knew what he was doing.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    For a period of three weeks, he immersed himself in the inner realities created by K, projecting them onto his outer reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He became convinced of the intervention in human affairs of the solid-state life forms elsewhere in the galaxy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He became convinced that it was necessary for him to go to the East Coast and warn the government about this extraterrestrial intervention in the affairs of Man. 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He told Toni that he must go to the East Coast.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She did not understand and tried to argue him out of it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He did not explain his mission to her.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt that he could not share this mission with anyone but those in power.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He flew to New York and took up residence in a hotel near Central Park.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He continued the administration of K to himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He obtained further supplies of K in New York through the prescriptions of medical doctors who were old friends of his.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The prescriptions were for migraine attacks.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He began to receive very strong messages to return to his old medical school, Dartmouth, at Hanover, New Hampshire.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He flew from New York to a New Hampshire airport near Hanover.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He arrived late at night.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He went into the men's room, gave himself a shot of K, came out of the men's room, and passed out on the floor.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Inside, he was in communication with the extraterrestrial solid-state civilization; outside, he was picked up by an emergency squad and taken to the Mary Hitchcock Hospital at Hanover.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the emergency ward he was recognized by a young psychiatrist, Michael.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Michael had had personal experience with the use of K on himself and on other people.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had a conference with his chief of service.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It was decided that he would accompany John back to New York.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    By this time John had come out of the effects of K, recognized Michael, and agreed to go to New York in Michael's company.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Michael stayed in the same suite of rooms as John and watched while John continued his injections of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John became reimmersed in the inner realities.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At one point he continued his mission to inform those in power of the dangers of the solid-state propaganda on the human species.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He called the White House and asked to speak to President Ford in Michael's presence.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    A commanding voice at the other end of the line said, 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "What do you wish to speak to the President about?"
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John: "I wish to speak to him about a danger to the human race involving atomic energy and computers."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The commanding voice said, " I will have to have more details than that.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Who are you?"
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John gave his name and continued his plea to talk to the President.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At this point Michael interrupted, said something into the phone to the person at the other end, and hung up.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He then turned to John and said, "You are in very poor shape.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    According to my chief, if this happened I was to arrange for you to enter a psychiatric hospital here in New York."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Michael, if you do that, you are my enemy."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Michael: "I am doing it for your own good and your future well-being.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You insist on remaining under the influence of K and doing things unacceptable to other people, endangering not only your life and limb but your future reputation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If you will not agree to sign yourself in, I will obtain the help of two New York doctors who will commit you to a psychiatric hospital."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "Come on, Michael, you understand K and its effects from your own experience.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    But you do not understand its longterm effects and the benefits of lowering one's threshold for awareness of extraterrestrial influence.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I refuse to sign myself in.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You get out of here."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Michael: "I am a lot stronger than you are, and I can get the help of the New York Police Department if you won't cooperate.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I have called two doctors who are willing to sign you in.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I can't, since I don't have a license to practice in New York State, but these two doctors have agreed to do it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They will put you under the care of a third doctor who has an appointment at that hospital.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He knows you and he also knows the effects of drugs on patients."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    With these threats John gave in.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The two doctors arrived, put him in their car, and took him to the hospital.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    His clothes and the K that he was carrying with him were forcibly removed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He suddenly realized that he was being subjected to that disqualified, second-class-citizen, inferior status of the mental patient in a psychiatric-hospital setting.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He remembered Thomas Szasz's writings entitled Psychiatric Justice.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As the effects of K began to wear off, he realized that he was in a battle for his freedom.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He asked the personnel to contact the head of the hospital so that he could talk to him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The chief psychiatrist came to his room and discussed his case with him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He said, "The law allows us to keep you here only for a period of five days.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If you wish to get out in spite of the attending physician, you must contact the Mental Health Commission of the State of New York."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John called the Mental Health Commission and talked to their legal counsel on the pay phone in the recreation room of his ward.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He called Toni long distance, explained what had happened, and asked for her help.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The attending psychiatrist came to see John.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    "John, you are obviously in a depression.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I want you to take an antidepressant.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Your use of K is a consequence of your depression.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You can avoid the necessity of taking K in the future by using my prescription."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "I couldn't be less depressed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I have long since left periods of depression behind me."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Doctor: "You just don't understand your own condition.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You have impaired thinking which can be corrected chemically.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I insist that you stay here until you agree to take the antidepressant."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John thought, Chemical control of human beings.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It reminds me of the old electrode story and the control of patients and animals.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Tranquilizers, energizers, antidepressant drugs are the new repertory of mental control.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The social machinery plus these drugs lead to control of people who are doing things that are unpleasant to other people.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The virtuous nature of the justifications that those in charge have for administering the drugs does not make it any more acceptable.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This doctor has no curiosity as to what's really going on in me.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He refuses to spend time to find out what the truth is in me; he wants to impose control over my mood and my state of being through chemical means.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I wonder how many of the drugs which he is prescribing to control people he has tried on himself to observe their effects, even as I have been doing with K?
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During the next three days, the psychiatric personnel interviewed John, tested him, and found that there was no mental illness.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    By this time the effects of K had worn off completely.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The head of the hospital reported to John that they couldfind no justification for keeping him, that he was being held only at the insistence of the attending physician who had been called in by Michael.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During a series of negotiations with the attending physician and the head of the hospital, it was arranged that John be transferred to another psychiatric hospital for further diagnosis.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Meanwhile, the legal counsel of the Mental Health Commission had come and talked to John about the problem of getting out from under the commitment proceedings.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She said that the commission could arrange for a hearing at the end of five days and free him from the hospital.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    However, this would mean a legal record and, hence, it would be preferable if other means could be worked out.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As a consequence of these considerations, John agreed to move to the other psychiatric institution, undergo further tests, and get opinions from those who were not involved in the original case.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Meanwhile, Toni had come to New York to enter into these negotiations and help John transfer to the other hospital.

    # Seduction by K 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The year in which John was investigating the effects of K on himself, he had one overriding belief system or, more properly, metabelief system, which controlled his entry and exit to and from other belief systems.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He called this overriding belief a "metabelief operator" (MBO).
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The MBO was: "In my development as a scientist I must approach the inner realities as well as the outer realities.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I must investigate the properties of the observer/ operator and his dependence upon the presence of changed molecular configurations within his own brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    K introduces certain specific changes in the molecular configuration and computation of that biocomputer.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Some of these changes are visible to outside observers, some are visible only to the inside observer/operator.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "The scientific observer/operator exists within two sets of realities, those of the human consensus reality, the external reality 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (e.r.), and the internal reality (i.r.).
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The e.r. and the i.r. exist simultaneously.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The observer/operator exists in the i.r. sometimes interlocked with the e.r. and sometimes in isolation, not so interlocked.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At high levels of concentration of K in the blood, the observer/ operator is cut off from his interlock with the e.r., including the human consensus reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The only physically safe and socially safe location to investigate this cutoff is floating in the isolation tank in a controlled environment, isolated from the necessity of interactions and transactions within the human consensus reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    One of the dangers in this exploration is allowing this cutoff of interlock to occur outside the isolation facility.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If in his exploration the observer/operator loses this perspective, he will inevitably be testing the limits of acceptance by the current human consensus reality, as an individual in the grips of a belief system counter to the current accepted belief systems."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During the first part of this year, John did experiments with single doses of K and arrived at a quantitative relation between the dose given and the resulting states of being induced in himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Later he took multiple doses more frequently and found new effects not accountable simply by the induced phenomena of single doses at widely spaced intervals.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At the beginning of the year he did not realize the longterm effects of repeated doses.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During that year he found that he entered into the overvaluation domain induced by repetitive doses of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Toni called this "being seduced by K."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The first few months were taken up with the determination of the effects of single doses separated by several days.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John worked in collaboration with Craig and several other young researchers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    No one yet knew of the long-term repeated-use trap.

    After the first dozen or so experiments designed to find the various thresholds for phenomena, John began to think in the following terms: "The time course of the effects of K after the time t0, the time of the injection into the muscles: There is a very rapid movement through the various phenomena for the first few minutes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The effects then level off for a period of approximately ten minutes and then gradually subside on a much slower time course.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These effects seem to be related to the changes in concentration of K within the bloodstream.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If we think in terms of a time-concentration-in-the-blood curve (Figure xK), we may be able to account for the results and the changes in the observer/ operator and his belief systems during the half hour to forty-five minutes of each experiment.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "After the time of the injection, there is a period of about three minutes when no effects are felt.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Rather abruptly, the effects begin and move rapidly through a series of phenomena too fast to be grasped.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After this rapid rise of effects, there is a stabilized plateau where one experiences phenomena which are dependent on how much K one has injected.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This phase lasts from ten to thirty minutes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    By controlling the initial dose one can control the period of time over which changes in the self and in the i.r. are experienced.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    One can also vary the phenomena experienced on this plateau by the amount of K injected.

    "As the amount of K in the blood decreases because of its destruction by the body, one can then see and analyze the phenomena that occur over a period of twenty minutes to forty minutes.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "There are apparently no aftereffects that are detectable by the inside observer after the falling phase of K concentration in the blood."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (Later John was to find that there was a small residual effect that lasted several hours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The falling curve did not go completely to zero.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The overvaluation trap would be found much later to be caused by this small residual effect unnoticed in the first set of experiments.) 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John did a series of experiments relating the amount injected to the phenomena experienced on the plateau.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He tried 10 milligrams at one injection.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The effects were almost undetectable.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was a slight change in body sensations but no detectable change in himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He then tried 20 milligrams and found an enhanced body energy and tingling in the skin.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was no change in the visual field or in his perception of himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He tried 30 milligrams.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After the initial rise of sensation, he began to sense changes in his perception (on the plateau).
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If he closed his eyes he could induce visual images: at first flat, twodimensional, uncolored; and, a few minutes later, three-dimensional, colored, and moving.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In this phase he became enthusiastic about the images, but not as enthusiastic as he had been under psychedelic agents.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He decided to test the difference between the various doses and the effects inside versus outside the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He started the tank work with a dose of 30 milligrams.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Freed from the effects of gravity, light, and sound in the tank, he was able to study the visual images in a more relaxed state.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the tank he saw continuous motion-picture-like sequences, highly colored, three dimensional, and consisting of, at first, inanimate scenes which later became populated with various strange and unusual creatures as well as human beings.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that he could change the content of these internal movies by the self-metaprogramming methods he had learned in the tank and, in 1964, had used in the tank under LSD.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At this point he realized that if he stayed in the external reality outside the tank, these images became interlocked with that reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They were modulated and modified by what was happening in the external world, whereas they were not in the tank because the e.r. was missing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was some spontaneous source of these images in the tank as well as the modifications introduced by him as the observer/operator in the system.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Early in the series he conceived of these spontaneous sources, i.e., something within his own brain which was generating the images in addition to his intentions for those images.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At the beginning of this series of experiments, he assumed the existence of a contained mind, with the observer contained within that mind within the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Later he was to believe otherwise�that the source of the images was coming from somewhere else, not his own brain, by means which he did not yet understand.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He then went on and experimented with higher doses.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He called the 30-milligram-dose threshold for visual projections the internal reality threshold, best seen in the isolation tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The next amount injected was 75 milligrams.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the tank he found the plateau involved whole sets of phenomena which he had not seen at the lower doses.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    For the first time he began to sense changes in himself other than the changes in perception of visual images.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His relationship to his physical body became weakened and attenuated.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that he began to participate in the scenes which were previously merely visual images, as if out there, outside of his body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His observer/ operator was becoming disconnected from the physical body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Information from his bodily processes was becoming so weakened that there were times when he was not aware of his body at all.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    On this plateau he began to experience interaction with the strange presences, strange beings, and began to communicate with them.

    The scene begins to fade.
  :Русский: |-

    John moves out of this extraterrestrial reality (e.t.r.), resumes his consciousness of his body, and sees the old familiar movies of Earthside scenes and his own memories.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Slowly these projected images fade and John is floating in the tank, remembering them in full detail.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He climbs out of the tank and dictates the experience into a tape recorder.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Thus did he find another threshold under the influence of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    H e began to cal l this the extraterrestrial reality threshold on which his observer/operator became involved as a participant.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The critical value of K at a single dose for exploring this realm was 75 milligrams.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The next threshold was found at 150 milligrams of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In order to see this threshold clearly, he found that he also had to be in the isolation tank free of the interlock with the external world.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    "I rapidly pass the i.r. threshold and the e.t.r. threshold, and suddenly 'I' as an individual disappears.

    "We are creating all that which happens everywhere.

    We have become bored with the void.

    We know we have been eternally, are eternally, and will be eternally.

    We have created several universes, have dissolved them, and have created new ones.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each universe we have created has become more complex, more amusing to us.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Our control of the current universe is on the upswing; it is becoming more complex as we regulate its regulation of itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As we experience each universe, our awareness of ourselves increases.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Each universe is a teaching machine for our awareness.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    To create a universe we first create light.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We contain the light within the universe, within the space that we create to contain the light.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We curve the space to contain the light.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "In the early universes we watched the light contained traveling through its empty spaces, bouncing off the periphery in the curvatures of the space.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We played with the size of those universes, expanding and contracting them, and watched the light.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Large universes finally bored us, the light merely traveled around and around.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "One universe that we created, we decreased in size until the light was chasing its own tail.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We found a new phenomenon, a new effect.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When we decreased the universe sufficiently, the light, in chasing its own tail at very small sizes, became stabilized.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The universe became a single particle of incredibly small dimensions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The light, in chasing its own tail, had generated this particle which had mass, inertia.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "In the universe after that one, we created many small particles encapsulating light chasing its own tail in the small dimensions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We found that some of these particles attracted one another, forming larger assemblages.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We played with these assemblages.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We found that light within these particles, rotating in certain directions, caused the attraction of other particles in which light was rotating in the opposite sense.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "In a later universe we allowed the creation of huge numbers of these encapsulated light particles.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We controlled their creation at one point and packed that small region with more and more particles.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We found that there was a critical point at which they exploded outward.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "In a later universe we re-created the exploding point, and as the particles spread outward we arranged for them to condense on new centers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These new centers continued outward until we closed that universe and its space.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "In a later universe we began to reassemble particles in various parts of that universe, set up creative centers within the space of that universe.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We set up points at which new particles were created and other points at which they were destroyed, reconverted into light.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "In a still later universe we allowed certain areas to become imbued with portions of our consciousness.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We watched their evolution and found that each of these areas as it evolved became conscious of itself.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "In the current universe we have many assemblages of particles which have self-awareness.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Some of them are huge, some of them are very small, a few have begun to question their own origins; a very, very few are becoming conscious of us.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We are beginning games with these very, very few, manipulating their awareness.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Most of these seem to be developing a sense of humor similar to ours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This universe is more amusing than the past ones."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John's consciousness and self-awareness condensed back into a single individual.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to experience himself as a self, separate.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He came back through the e.t.r., into the i.r., and finally into his body in the e.r., which was the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He labeled the domain of losing self and becoming "We " the Network of Creation (N).
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He then tried the 300-milligram-threshold dose.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that this plateau was beyond anything he could describe.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It was as if he had entered a void, had become the void beyond any human specification.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In returning from the void, he went through the creative network, the extraterrestrial reality, the internal reality, back into his body in the tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that, as a human being, he would be unable to use these larger-dose regions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He would be unable to describe what happened, so he labeled this high-dose threshold U, the Unknown.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At this point he abandoned study of the higher doses leading to the Unknown (U).
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He now began to see the dimensions of the exploration and the parameters he had to explore.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He divided the experiments into those to be done in the tank and those to be done in the human consensus reality, with single other individuals and with unprotected situations, not in his home.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    New dangers were to appear, one of which would terminate this exploration and render him incapacitated in a bed at home for a period of twelve weeks.

    # K and Interlock with the External Reality 
  :Русский: |-

    For twenty minutes Craig jumped up and down on spread feet, bent knees, and body bent at the waist with his arms curled forward, howling like a chimpanzee.
  :Русский: |-

    As the howling, the motions, and the posture returned to that of a human, John said to Craig, "Where did you go?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Craig: "I went back to the beginnings of the evolution of Man. I became the predecessor of a caveman.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I saw a sabertoothed tiger and howled my defiance at him.
  :Русский: |-

    As he left I ran for a tree.
  :Русский: |-

    I climbed it and, as I was coming out of K, I found myself sitting in the tree looking at you."
  :Русский: |-

    John: "Do you want toknow whatyou looked like out here?"
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Craig: "Yes."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "You looked like an epileptic having a petit mal seizure.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    You were staring straight ahead and acting as if you were a chimpanzee howling.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I will play back the tape and let you hear how you were sounding for that period of time."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As the sounds of Craig's cries came from the tape recorder, his face lit up and he began to laugh.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John: "You can afford to laugh.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I had to stand here and listen to that and watch you, hoping that you weren't going to attack me.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I would like to make a strong suggestion to you.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If you ever do that again I'm going to kick you in the rear end."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Craig: "Ah, come on, Doc, don't take it so seriously.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Let's find out what we can about this.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It looks as if automatisms can take place under the influence of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Just before I went under, I decided on the regression program back to the beginnings of Man. It was a very interesting domain which I've explored before with other chemical agents in me.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Apparently we have primitive primate programs buried in our central nervous system.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We can activate these in special states of being.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The question is whether we are creating these from our own fantasies or whether they are really built into the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This is a fascinating puzzle."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Craig had injected 100 milligrams of K before this experience started.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John and Craig agreed that he had passed through the i.r. threshold and the e.t.r. threshold but had stopped short of the network threshold.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This decision was based on the fact that he maintained an individuality, that he had not been immersed in the creative network, becoming a "We " rather than an "I.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    " Craig described his surroundings during the experience as the surface of the planet Earth something on the order of six million years ago.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the experience he possessed no human language.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His postexperience judgment was that he was an organism of the primate series which had preceded the evolution of humans as we know them.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The series of joint experiments then continued with Craig in the tank and John as safety man. Thus they discovered the most dangerous aspect of K exploration.

- :Английский: |-
    As both Craig and John began to realize, during the period from the injection to the immersion in the internal reality (i.r.) at the higher dosages, it was imperative that there be controls on the body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The safest place to make these transitions was in the tank in a preprogramming leading to bodily immobility.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The excitation of motor mechanisms within the brain tended to persist beyond the point at which the observer could control them.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The brain "went on automatic" and the observer lost control of it under these particular circumstances.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They agreed that there was a dangerous disengagement of the self from the bodily control systems, and the bodily control systems persisted in actions which they were taking before this disengagement took place.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In Craig and John's mutual explorations, they arrived at formulation of the first danger of K: At certain critical doses and certain critical concentrations of K in the brain, the subcortical systems continue their automatic activities out of contact with the observer in the brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Do not ever get caught without a safety man when exploring this domain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Restrain such experiments to the isolation tank with a safety man present.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (In late r years, reviewing th e happenings of that crucial year, John came to call these directions he and Craig had worked out the First Prime Directive.) 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John now entered a new phase of investigation of K and its effects on him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He and Craig became temporarily separated and John pursued the work on his own.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He began his exploration of the effect of small repeated doses of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He wanted to find out if by means of such doses he could remain above a given threshold (see Figure lK) for longer periods of time than he could achieve with a single isolated dose.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This experimentation was limited by his ability to give himself a dose.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    If a previous dose put him above the extraterrestrial reality 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    (e.t.r.) level, he found he was unable to carry out the operation of giving himself an injection.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the first experiment in this series, he began by giving himself a 30-milligram dose.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that he just touched the internal reality (i.r.) threshold on the plateau of the effect.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He repeated the 30-milligram dose at fifteen minutes from the first injection.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    On the plateau, he found that he had moved above the i.r. threshold and began to see visual movies with his eyes closed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After fifteen minutes he gave himself the third injection and saw that at the peak he was above the e.t.r. threshold.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He let the effects of K wear off for twenty-four hours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had found a new effect of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Doses were additive if timed correctly.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The next experiment involved repeated doses of 75 milligrams (Figure 2K).
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    On the first dose he passed the i.r. threshold and hit the e.t.r. threshold.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was immersed in a scene in which he was participating which was not connected to his external reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The scene had the alien qualities characteristic of the e.t.r. threshold.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As he returned from this participation into the i.r. region andfinally back to the external reality, he gave himself the second dose of 75 milligrams.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This time he passed the i.r. threshold and went deeply into the e.t.r. domain, farther than he had gone with the first dose.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For a few minutes of clock time he participated in alien regions beyond his comprehension.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As the K effect began to wear off, he came back to the e.r., floating in the tank with the door open and the lights on in the room.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Almost automatically he looked at the clock, saw that fifteen minutes had passed since the last dose, and gave himself the third injection.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This time he rapidly penetrated through the i.r. and the e.t.r. and joined the network (N).
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As he was split out from the network, he traversed another alien extraterrestrial environment (e.t.r.), became immersed in his own internal reality (i.r.), in which he began to remember having given himself three injections, and came back into his body, the tank with the door open, and the lighted room.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As he lay in the tank contemplating these results, he became veTy enthusiastic and quite exultant about the phenomena experienced.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He now had a certain measure of limited control over traversing into various regions for short periods of time.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He repeated this experiment once a day for the following week.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to detect a new effect.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He found that there was a carry-over effect from the multiple doses of one day, enabling him to move more easily into the inner spaces, the inner domains, more easily with each experiment.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    By this time his motivation was changing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to value these inner experiences more than he did his relationships with the external world and other persons.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to take on a new belief system.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Somehow I am being programmed by sources far greater than the human.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In my old terminology, super-self metaprogramming is taking place.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I am doing these experiments at the behest of someone or something far greater than I or the human species.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Whoever they are, they want to do these experiments.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "They seem to be the two Beings that I met early in the series, some sort of teachers or guides who are insisting that I pursue this particular mission."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    About this time Toni became aware of changes beginning in John.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She found that he was spending less and less time with her and more time in the isolation facility on his experiments.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was becoming less available for their dyadic joint life together.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Meanwhile John was having difficulties obtaining sufficient K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had several sources; one of these became aware of the fairly large amounts that he was requesting.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This source refused to give him any more.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found other sources and continued the work.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The new belief system of being programmed by suprahuman entities became his primary motivation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had given himself so many injections that the pattern of giving the injections had become automatic.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    While still immersed in the i.r., he could give himself an additional dose to penetrate into the deeper regions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The injection process had become an automatism no longer needing his conscious control of what the body did.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Long ago he had abandoned his and Craig's First Prime Directive.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He entered into a new, far more dangerous phase of his exploration and his new mission.

    # Living in the Internal Reality and the Extraterrestrial Reality 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John decided to try to live in the internal reality, continuously for an extended period, peaking into the extraterrestrial reality (e.t.r.) and contacting the network (N), staying out of the Unknown (U).
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He found, by giving himself 50 milligrams every hour on the hour, twenty hours a day, with four hours out for sleep, that he was able to maintain the schedule for three weeks.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The experiment ended at three weeks as the result of an accident in the external reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    By the end of the first day he was able to maintain the i.r. because of the accumulated effect of the many doses that he had taken.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    No matter what he was doing, he could close his eyes and see colored three-dimensional motion pictures.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He studied these in the darkened tank for many hours at a time.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that they would be maintained if he sat in a bathtub ir\ a dark bathroom.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Even though his activities in the external world were restricted, the i.r. came to be present continuously, day and night.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    After each dose of 50 milligrams every hour on the hour, he spent some time in the extraterrestrial reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At the beginning this time was approximately twenty minutes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After the first week it had lengthened to a period of forty minutes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the second and third weeks, he felt the extraterrestrial reality continuously, even when the internal reality and the external reality were available.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The boundaries between the three realities became less definite.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that while he was moving around in the external world, he could feel the influences of the Beings of the extraterrestrial reality (e.t.r.); any time he closed his eyes, even in bright sunlight, he could see the internal motion pictures.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "That man I see on television is a direct agent of the extraterrestrial reality controlling all human life.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He is giving a public speech on television to the human species in order to program them into believing that he is not an extraterrestrial agent.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In reality, he is controlled by the solid-state life forms of the civilization of another place in our galaxy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It is obvious that what he is saying is to hide his real mission."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John was watching and listening to a powerful figure in the United States government, Elliot Richardson.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As he spoke the television set became brighter and there was a sense of importance to what he was saying.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When someone else came on to make comments about what he had just said, the set went dimmer, the picture was less clear, less important.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John thought, "The solid-state systems on Earth are being modulated by solid-state life forms elsewhere in the galaxy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This television set and all the communication links hooking it into the television networks in the United States are being controlled by a solid-state entity elsewhere."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Suddenly the channel he was watching went blank; the TV station was cut off. It stayed off for one minute and came back on again.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John thought, "The solid-state entity is demonstrating its control to me by this technique."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During these three weeks Toni took John to see the movie entitled Executive Action, based on a conspiracy to assassinate John Kennedy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Watching this movie he saw the same effect that he had seen on the TV screen.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Certain portions of the movie were enhanced in brilliance and took on a heightened significance.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John thought, " I am being controlled by the solid-state entity.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The control of my brain by this entity causes portions of this film to be emphasized to teach me those portions which are messages from the solid-state entity."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    During this period John became convinced that he was a visitor from the year 3001.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt that everything around him was happening in that year.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When traveling in automobiles he felt the primitiveness of their mechanisms.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He longed to return to the year 3001 in which the vehicles produced steam instead of contaminating exhaust gases.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Everything he saw had a patina of old age, as if in a museum, including human beings.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Clothing and machines seemed old, antique.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Paintings looked as though they had been made by artists long since dead.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He briefly began a search for the time machine which had transported him backward in time to the twentieth century.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He could not find it and realized that the Beings from another dimension had this control over him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He developed the belief that a Being from the year 3001 had taken over his body.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After a few days this Being left and he returned to his twentieth-century self.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    While John was believing that the Being from the year 3001 was literally himself, he interacted with the people in his external environment in ways that were totally uncharacteristic of him before his seduction by K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    To them he had become a very young, very naive boy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He did not interact in their conversations in his usual quick and witty fashion.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Instead, he apparently was immersed within himself, yet watching them and their interactions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Every so often he would perform some out-of-context action which resulted in their surprise or shock.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Once, a friend who had interviewed John for a magazine visited the house with his new girl friend.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The young boy who was John became entranced with her beauty.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He stared at her beautiful face unremittingly.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He then had the impulse to fondle her breasts, walked around behind her, put his hands on her breasts, and fondled them.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He ignored the shocked reactions of Toni, of his friend, and, of course, of the young woman, and immersed himself in a fantasy with her.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In his fantasy she and he were making love as two naive children would make love.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The man involved in this episode was a protagonist of the new-consciousness, human-potential movement.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He could not accept the obviously changed John and from that point on maintained a safe distance from him and Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Even several years later he could not resume his old friendship with John.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Toward the end of this three-week period, John noticed a broken shelf beside his bed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He asked Toni how it had gotten broken.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She looked at him rather quizzically and said, "You fell on it last night."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John couldn't remember this accident.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This brought him up rather short and he realized that dangerous automatisms and coma had entered into the picture.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He stopped taking K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He found that it took him about three days to lose the internal reality effect and the extraterrestrial reality effect.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He went into isolation and tried to work out what had happened during those three weeks.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He began to realize that the old picture which he and Craig had constructed had become very different.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The sharp thresholds which they had postulated for single doses did not apply to chronic hourly administration of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These sharp thresholds during the three weeks had become coextensive.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The external reality (e.r.), the internal reality (i.r.), the extraterrestrial reality (e.t.r.), and at times even the network (N) had grown very, very close together.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the chronic administration, a single dose would re-create all of these phenomenological domains.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Between doses the belief systems inherent in these domains took over all his relationships within the external human consensus reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During the three weeks, he had taken some five hundred doses of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Not only was there not enough time between injections for the K in his body to be destroyed, but the whole structure of his belief systems was changed, lowering the thresholds for the effects of experiences in the i.r., the e.t.r., and the N.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Subsequent to the three weeks of experimentation, John and Toni gave a workshop together.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They had contracted to do it before the period of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was some doubt in Toni's mind as to whether John could function at this point in his usual way, but they drove to Big Sur and started the workshop anyway.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John continued the injections of K during his exposure to participants of the workshop and members of the staff of the institute.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He felt as if he were an Indian sage or an extraterrestrial being who was observing a group of humans on a peculiar planet called Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    To Toni, those in the workshop, and the staff, he seemed very withdrawn, extremely calm, as if he were continuously in the state called Samadhi.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In exchanges with members of the workshop, he observed and participated only rarely.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    At one point he listened very carefully to a man from Texas who kept repeating himself as he had done in previous workshops.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Even though he had been living at the institute for long periods of time, he obviously had not made much progress in changing himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He protested about his difficulties and at the same time kept talking about his Cadillac car.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In John's internal reality this man was merely repeating an old pattern and not really examining himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Despite his protestations that he wanted to change his states of consciousness, he was not doing anything to accomplish this.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He asked John what he should do.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John replied from his position of removed, objective, extraterrestrial sage, " I hear you driving your Cadillac.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I do not hear you driving yourself to change yourself."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The man reacted by withdrawing within himself, shocked by this direct challenge.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the presence of this strange, extraterrestrial John, Toni took on the burden of replying to and helping to program the members of the workshop.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Outside of the sessions she was given considerable support by the staff of the institute.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Toni learned who could be tolerant of changes in states of being and states of consciousness and who could not.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She watched the interactions of staff and others with John and realized that there were very few persons who could perceive such changes, accept them, and interact with John in an effective fashion.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    To those few, his behavior was completely understandable; to the others it was totally outrageous.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She saw that the human world divided into those who had real insight into states of being and consciousness and those who only said that they had such insight.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    By this time all his sources of supply of K had become wary.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Some of the friends with whom he had left K became very cautious and refused to give him what was in their care.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He went through a severe withdrawal period in which he missed K and its induced effects.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During this period he was described by one of his best friends to be "like an alcoholic who could not obtain alcohol."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John vehemently denied this parallel, still caught in the seduction of K and still caught in his mission.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He decided to try a chemical substance closely related to K but which had longer-lasting effects.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had not tried this substance, but he had heard a good deal about it from friends among the young M.D.s who had used it.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This was twelve months after the beginning of the experiments with Craig.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Up to this time Toni had accepted what John was doing and justified it to the many friends who objected.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She had stood by John in spite of his remoteness, in spite of his isolation, and in spite of his separation from her inside his own head.

    She knew that she was married to an unusual, unique human individual who had purposes very different from those of anyone else that she had ever known.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At one point she said to a friend, "If he were an ordinary person doing these stupid things, it would be easy for me.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I could pick up and leave.
  :Русский: |-

    But he is not.
  :Русский: |-

    I can't expect to lead an ordinary, quiet life while living with a genius."
  :Русский: |-

    Much later an interviewer asked Toni what it was like to live with John.

    She said, "Sometimes I yeam for trivia."

    John obtained the substance related to K, kept it hidden, and waited until Toni left the house.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    After she was gone he gave himself an injection.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John didn't know that it required longer to take effect than K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He made a strategic error in not realizing the longtime course of the buildup, the plateau, and the decay of this new substance in his brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had not prepared himself to stay in the isolation facility and in the tank for the requisite number of hours.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He made the mistake of continuing to walk around in the external reality.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    As the new substance began to take effect, John was transported into the joys of his childhood.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He became a little boy once more, happily enjoying the sunshine, the flowers, and the plants around his home.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He felt his body and his motions with intense, rewarding pleasure.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Under the influence of the new, longer-lasting chemical similar to K, he responded to a call for help from Toni.
  :Русский: |-

    Several days before, John had installed a locking gas cap on the VW camper.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Toni had left the house and taken the VW down the canyon.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At the nearest gas station she tried to get gasoline, found the gas cap locked, and realized that John had not given her the key.
  :Русский: |-

    In response to her call, John decided to meet her down the road to give her the key.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    John got on the bicycle, looked down at his feet with great joy, and said to himself, as it were, "This is the first time I've been on a bicycle with such joy since I was a little boy first learning how to ride."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John went down the road on the bicycle, met Toni, and gave her the key.
  :Русский: |-

    She turned the VW around and went down the canyon road.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John followed her.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the state induced by the chemical, his interlock with the external reality became disconnected.
  :Русский: |-

    The bicycle was traveling about thirty miles an hour down the twisting, turning road.
  :Русский: |-

    Suddenly the chain came off, the rear wheel locked, and John hit the road.

    # Third Conference of Three Beings 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "I have called this meeting to report the close of the year of education of my agent on the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I would like to give a short review of that year and its termination.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "I and several other Beings with agents on the planet Earth were very busy at this time with the coincidence control of this particular agent.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I operated in close cooperation with the Second Being, who was controlling the agent called Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "There were times when our coincidence controls had to be introduced with an exquisite sense of timing.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At one point the Second Being and I arranged for the agent Toni to read an account of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, preprogramming her for an episode that happened three days later in which she found the body of the agent, John, floating in the swimming pool.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Another Being had to be enlisted to time the publication of that account of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation in the paper which Toni sometimes read.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Coincidences were arranged for her to buy that issue of that paper and read it.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "In this episode we enlisted the aid of another Being who prodded another agent, Phil, at the critical time to make a telephone call trying to reach John through Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This led her to try to find John and to discover his body in the swimming pool.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The previously mentioned coincidence control pattern allowed Toni to save him by mouth-to-mouth techniques."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "I note that the educational process was terminated.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    How was this accomplished?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "This was done in cooperation with many agents, who gradually arranged for coincidences to cut off the supply of the substance K which John was using during the educational process.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The human vehicle had become 'seduced by K.' By this time he was sufficiently educated to seek a longer-acting substance similar to K but lasting several days instead of minutes.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    By arranging a series of coincidences, I led John to obtain a large enough amoimt of this substance for the final scene of the termination process.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I arranged for him to purchase a bicycle and use it at the critical time of the oncoming effects of that substance, and with the cooperation of the Second Being I arranged for Toni to leave the scene.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "At this point exquisite, fast timing of events was necessary.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "As John wasriding the bicycle down the canyon road, I chose a place for the chain to lock the rear wheel.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At this particular instant his body was in such a position that as he fell he received painful but not fatal injuries.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I arranged for his biocomputer to be uninjured to preserve the vehicle for a future mission."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Second Being: "I t took a good deal of careful preparation over a long period of time of the agent, Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Her protective care of John had to be preserved for future use.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    And yet it was necessary to remove her from the scene so that we could terminate his use of these substances.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There was a delicate balance of maintaining his cover of the use of the chemicals and, at the same time, arranging the supply of one more substance in the human consensus reality and inducing the agent Toni to leave so that the process could be completed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Later she experienced some guilt about being away from him at this particularly crucial time; however, her education as an agent on Earth required this series of coincidence controls."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "In cooperation with several other agents, we overdetermined the coincidences so that the agent John would get to the hospital with no further injuries.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We arranged for three persons to call the Rescue Squad, the sheriff, and the Fire Department.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Once the agent John was injured, we made sure he would be taken care of in the human consensus reality despite his inability to take care of himself as a result of the injuries and the substance within his biocomputer.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "I t was realized that he must be put through a new phase of his education while in the hospital.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    While he was in coma, sedated, tranquilized, and under the influence of painkillers, the Second Being and I took him to other planets on which catastrophic planetwide disasters were taking place.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He wrote these experiences up later in a book."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    " 
  :Русский: |-
    " 
- :Английский: |-
    Second Being: "I t was necessary to arrange for the education of the agent Toni during this period.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Throughout John's educational process, she was educated in parallel.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I cooperated with the Third Being throughout that year.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the hospital I arranged for her to test John Junior, the son of John, and to educate him further as to who she really is.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During that year the agent Toni learned that she can depend on her deep self; she learned that she has deep reservoirs of loyalty, of trust, of strength which she can exert on behalf of her own human vehicle, on behalf of John, and on behalf of her extended family.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    She learned all this despite the fact that it was a very stress-filled period for her vehicle."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "By this process the coincidences were arranged to put the agent John through a twelve-week period of intense physical pain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As a result of the accident, he refused the use of any further chemical substances, including those prescribed by his doctor.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We arranged for him to be twenty-four hours a day in his home with Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was given time to integrate the previous year, to integrate the essentially delicate and mortal nature of his physical body and its recuperative powers.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This training freed him of the necessity for using any further chemical agents.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had found that his biocomputer tended to become simplified in its programming under the influence of K.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He made many discoveries about the relation of the self to the body, to the external world, and to the human consensus reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The reverberations of this educational year of John's are still resounding in the human consensus reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Only at the present time have I felt that he can share his education with other humans who need the knowledge he has acquired.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Other human agents now need to know his story.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "At this meeting I would like it to be decided whether this story is to be released as he is currently writing it."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "Le t us decide that question later.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I have been told by higher levels that during that year he was allowed to penetrate above our level.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    What do you have to say about this?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "Yes, several times I accompanied him into what he calls the extraterrestrial reality, and he saw and communicated with his simulation of the Second Being and myself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    During that time we communicated directly with him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When we felt that he was sufficiently educated about us and our abilities to take care of him in the other domains, we arranged for him to penetrate to the higher levels with us.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He and we became dissolved in the way familiar to us into what he later called the Network of Creation.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He and we lost our identities and fused with those whom he calls We.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "After a sufficient immersion in the Network, we returned him to his body on the planet Earth."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "As I remember, several years ago you transported him to this domain several times."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "Yes, we did.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At that time he wasn't quite ready to accept the existence of the higher levels, and he later attributed the experiences to his own simulations of the creative process in the universe."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "What is the current status of his belief about us and about the Network of Creation?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Third Being: "He tends to oscillate somewhat between belief in the reality of our existence and belief that these experiences are a consequence of holding to our existence as if real.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There is still somewhat of a tendency to flip from belief in us as real to belief that this is a simulation."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "I wish to defer to a later meeting the question of whether he is to be allowed to publish the current account of his education and to break cover on what he has found out.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The long-term coincidence control pattern may include such publication.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At this time we estimate from information derived from higher levels and intelligences which both of you have collected that the probability of publication is not yet certain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The decision is not completely in our hands; higher levels insist on further evaluation and correlation with other agents on the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I will let you both know at a later time how these probabilities are developing, and at the next meeting we can make the decision whether, at our level of control, he is to be allowed to publish.

    # Life Refuses Closure

    Are the three Beings real?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Are any not-human Beings real?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Am I being advised by them?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Will they arrange for coincidence control to publish what I have written?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Will there be repercussions from the human consensus reality if what I have written is published?
  :Русский: |-

    Can I obtain the advice of the Being in control of my coincidences?
  :Русский: |-

    Despite sixty-one trips about the sun on the spaceship Earth, my body still functions more or less satisfactorily.
  :Русский: |-

    It still disturbs me at times.
  :Русский: |-

  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When this human vehicle dies, will there be something of me and beyond me which continues?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Is my affirmative answer, "Yes, Beings beyond humans exist," merely a product of the desires of my brain and my body to continue to survive beyond their earthly existence?
  :Русский: |-

    Is all of me�my consciousness, my awareness, my thinking, my love, my relations with others�terminable or interminable?

    Man's fondest illusions are packaged in me even as they are in all others.
  :Русский: |-

    My programs for survival seem to be built into the genetic code assuring the future of the species.
  :Русский: |-

    Somehow, once protoplasm formed on this planet, it exerted a consistent inner force to reproduce itself and continue inhabiting the surface of the earth.
  :Русский: |-

    Is our love and compassion merely an expression of this innate characteristic of our protoplasmic origins?
  :Русский: |-

    Are we more than individuals of one hundred billion cells each, totaling the four billion human beings on this planet?
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    First Being: "The higher levels of coincidence control have instructed me to call this meeting.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Long-term human coincidence control patterns on the planet Earth are changing, pointing to a critical, crucial decision for all life on that planet.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The human race now has the power to decide whether to continue life on earth or wipe it out in any of five different ways.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The first method currently would be to totally contaminate the surface of the planet with radioactivity and nuclear explosions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They are playing games with nuclear weapons and nuclear power.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As w e know, other planets have killed off all life as the humans know it by nuclear methods.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "The second destructive force available is chemical and biological agents inimical to all mammalian life forms including the human species.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Individual human agents have been killed with these substances.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Nerve gases and strange new toxins and viruses have been created artificially.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "The third method involves their beginning understanding of their own structure.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They have discovered those molecular configurations of which their own genes are built.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They have begun to see that they are not too different from other animals or even from plants.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their new understanding of this basic building block of themselves and of all life is leading them to experiment with artificial forms of life.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Sinc e they do not understand as yet the total interdependence of all organisms on that planet, they do not realize that millions of types of organisms have disappeared because their genetic code was inappropriate for the particular time, place, and climate in which they developed spontaneously.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Without such knowledge they may produce new organisms, new to them, which will be distinctly out of place, out of time and out of the evolutionary sequence established on earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They may discover some organisms which can eliminate them and all other mammals.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "The fourth danger area in which they are caught has to do wit h the organization of large human groups with belief systems counter to survival of themselves and other human groups.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There are peculiar human values connected to territory, connected to such dogma as, 'My beliefs are greater than yours; you must take on my beliefs or I will kill you.' They have developed methods of training their children in their traditional beliefs.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These entrenched beliefs then cause the children as adults to cohere to one another and to their traditions in ever larger groups.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Such human structures lead them to use other methods on one another in order to kill rather than educate those they call their enemies.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    As their power over natural processes increases, these dedicated groups are likely to obtain enough control over the first three methods to sacrifice the rest of humanity and the other organisms of Earth in a futile struggle to master one another.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "The fifth area of potential destruction is the human species' arrogance.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Humans have a pride in their knowledge, as if this knowledge were complete and possessed closure.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Only very few humans realize that pride in one's knowledge and shame of one's ignorance lead to the arrogance which is threatening the other species on earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The humans continue to kill other species, irrespective of the large, fine brains which those species possess.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The large minds of the whales and the dolphins are not granted credence by Man. The large, fine brains and large minds of the elephants are totally ignored; these animals are killed and controlled by groups of the smaller-brained, smaller-minded, ignorant humans.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Have either of you found any signs on the planet Earth that long-term coincidence control patterns should be modified to include the survival of water-based life on that planet?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Do you have any information that I can carry back to the higher levels of coincidence control which determine long-term coincidences to forestall the demise of the consciously aware organisms on the planet?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Second Being: "As you know, the human consensus reality has been mainly male dominated.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The reproduction of the species has been left to automatic programs within the males and the females.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Most male humans are not aware of the automatic nature of their drives to reproduce.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Most female humans have been forced by their long pregnancies to devote more of their thought, their feelings, and their relationships to that which carries the human species forward.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Within each reproductive female there is something which understands and intuitively feels what will lead to survival of all species.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    However, the females are subject to the restless, aggressive programming of the males.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Currently they are beginning to organize themselves, and those males who can hear them, into groups which value continued life above tradition.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Females who develop confidence in their intuitive understanding of life, such as my human agent, Toni, are becoming confident of their powers to exert their influence in the human consensus reality.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They hope to prevent the disasters brought about by the predominantly male scientific advancements."
  :Русский: |-

    Third Being: "I have some data derived from my relations with the human agent on Earth, John.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Our education of him has led to his abandoning further experiments such as those he did with brain electrodes, with LSD, and with substance K and the isolation tank.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Over his life we have finally educated him to the point where he can see much more clearly the dangers to all species of the present science, engineering, and social structures.

    We have subjected him to enough ruthless education in what he believes controls the universe.

    John ruminated about the dolphins, the whales, and the porpoises.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He thought of new devices to be constructed of solid-state parts which would be necessary to open a technical doorway to the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that, in order to convince Man of the high level of intelligence, compassion, and sentience of the Cetacea, the interchange of ideas between humans and Cetacea must be promoted.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The fifty-million-year accumulation of wisdom by the whales and dolphins, their knowledge of the total interdependence of organisms of the sea, must be opened up for Man. 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He conceived of new ways to convince other humans of the large minds of the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that computers must be used to train dolphins and whales to communicate with Man in those areas where Man feels preeminent�his computations, his logic, his consciousness, his relationships, his communication, his truth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The dolphins and whales must have teaching programs giving them codes with which to operate the computers to solve problems posed by Man�in computations, in logic, in self-initiative.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    One demonstration of this was badly needed.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He hoped that within the next few years he would be instrumental in bringing about this beginning of a new appreciation of the capabilities of life in the sea by Man. 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He had a new understanding of his skepticism about his own ideas, about his own beliefs; he hoped it would help him to apply himself to his new tasks.
  :Русский: |-

    He felt he must rise above his pessimism and enter into the dolphin puzzle with his full powers, understanding, interest, dedication, and whatever financial means he could find.

    He began his task by organizing, with his wife, Toni, Burgess Meredith, Victor di Suvero, and Tom Wilkes, the Human/ Dolphin Foundation in Malibu, California.

- :Английский: |-
    He began to make contacts with those who could help in the financing of the new projects.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He sought those younger engineers, scientists, musicians, artists, biologists, and others who could accomplish the mission.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized that he did not have much time left on the planet as a human being.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He also realized that his influence was relatively limited.
  :Русский: |-

    It would be necessary for him to use all accesses available to him within the human consensus reality in order to carry out the desired program.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He saw that he must write an authoritative book about the mission of communicating with the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Such a book was needed in order to provide the facts to those who wished them, insofar as these facts had been determined to date.

    The book also might function as a textbook to educate future generations about their kindly neighbors in the ocean.

    In a 1979 Pasadena conference, John Lilly talked of equipping a CMC stepvan with computers, signal analysis equipment, and software to create a dolphin whistle language.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The intermediary language that evolved was named after the god of portals, Janus; whose initials stood for Joint Analog Numerical Understanding System.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A team of us formed at Marine World Africa USA in Redwood City, around John Lilly and Project JANUS.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    We all worked as volunteers, because we loved being near the dolphins, Joe and Rosalie.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Joe and Rosie were two Atlantic bottlenose dolphins captured for this communication research.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When the work was over, they were released off the southeast Atlantic.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    What was learned from the Janus Project was that dolphins could demonstrate knowledge of a whistle language, and could associate whistle words with objects and actions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    But, it was not interactive communication.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Also, the choice of whistles for the language was not the best one.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Most of the dolphin's natural communication occurs as high bandwidth clicks, which are higher in frequency than whistles.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    But whistles are easier to produce accurately (by humans), than clicks.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Dolphins produce both clicks and whistles by shuttling air rapidly backand forth through chambers near their blowhole.
  :Русский: |-

    Lilly would sometimes like to listen to the dolphins on the underwater speaker in the isolation tank on the Marine World back lot.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He would put a microphone near his head and whistle and click back to the dolphins.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Floating in the isolation tank gave insights to a floating intelligence, and led to fantastic swim sessions with Joe and Rosie.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    More personally meaningful communication exchanges occurred in the swim interactions than the language sessions.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    John and Toni Lilly had droves of friends that came through Marine World to swim with the dolphins.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    People like Ram Dass, Patricia Sun, Joan Halifax, Olivia Newton John, and others swam with Joe and Rosie.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Some were delighted by the experience, and some were scarred by it.
  :Русский: |-

    Working with dolphins awakened the fantasy of a human/dolphin community, a place on the edge of the ocean where dolphin and human families could grow up together.

    We saw that dolphins get along well with children when Janet Lederman, director of Esalen Institute, brought the Gazebo kids to swim with Joe and Rosie.

    The dolphins were careful with children, and with handicapped people.

- :Английский: |-
    The children love being in the water with dolphins.

    # Simulation of the Future of Man, Dolphin, and Whale 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In solitude John contemplated alternative futures for Man and the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    His skepticism and pessimism dominated him at the beginning of this consideration.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Let me assume that we do break the communication barrier by modern technical methods and establish communication between us and them.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Can this be done openly, publicly, with the cooperation of the new generation of humans?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In my current pessimistic mood, I visualize scenarios in which those in power� the corporations, the military, the covert intelligence servicessolve this problem before it is solved publicly.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    What would happen under those circumstances?"
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In this first alternative scenario for the future, one can visualize what will happen on the basis of public knowledge, without knowing what is being done under top security.
  :Русский: |-

    The Naval Undersea Center has released two films; one shows human control of dolphins by means of Wayne Batteau's transphonemator.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A human is shown operating this device, talking to a dolphin in Hawaiian.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The dolphin responds by moving in certain directions and accomplishing a specific task.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    For some unknown reason the film leaves out the dolphin's vocal responses.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When this device was demonstrated to John by Batteau several years ago, the dolphin responded to the commands by whistles which the device turned into human vowel sounds.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    At that time the dolphin did twenty separate actions in response to the human voice.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Batteau had spent two weeks in the Miami laboratory with John before he developed this method, seeing the results of dolphin research there.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The effectiveness of the device in training dolphins was shown graphically in the Naval Undersea Center's film.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The second N.U.C. film is entitled "Deep Ops."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    A pilot whale with special devices retrieves a missile from the ocean floor.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The sound track on the film says, "No unusual methods have been used to train this whale."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Nothing is said about using the human voice for the control of the whale.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Without showing it, the sound track also says that a killer whale was trained in the same way.
  :Русский: |-

    On national TV on the Tomorrow show, Tom Snyder interviewed a man named Michael Greenwood.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Greenwood claimed that he had been involved in Navy-sponsored research in which dolphins were trained to place packages on the bottoms of ships and submarines.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These packages could contain either explosives or devices to monitor what was going on in the ship or the submarine, presumably nuclear-powered ones.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    In the motion picture The Day of the Dolphin, dolphins are shown placing such an explosive package on the bottom of a yacht in which a group of secret agents who stole the dolphins are waiting.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The yacht blows up and the dolphins return to their

    Scott.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    According to a brochure which the Avco Company released with the movie, it was suggested that this movie was based on the research of Dr. John Lilly and on a novel (translated from French) written by Robert Merle.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Presumably the dolphins here were taught to speak a primitive form of English with open 'mouths.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    To those who have heard the real tapes of real dolphins attempting to speak English (with open blow-hole and closed mouth), it was obvious that the movie faked the voice of the dolphin in the air.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The Naval Undersea Center's films imply that the Navy has gone much farther than the films show, released as they are for public education and justification of the Center's budget.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Greenwood allegations that the Navy and the CIA have been misusing dolphins in covert operations, as demonstrated in the movie Day of the Dolphin, establish a rather pessimistic alternative scenario for the future of the relations between dolphin and Man. 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    To John this was public evidence of how his early research with dolphins could be used in the service of those who put making war above obtaining new knowledge.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized the power of desperate men fighting other desperate men.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Their adequately funded secret work and the entertainment based on their work created an impression of dolphin research in the public mind which was counter to the evolution of good relations between Man and Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    One imagines that Man would never really communicate with the Cetacea under the auspices of such agencies.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The aims of their research are to use the Cetacea in the service of Man's warfare on Man. In the present human consensus reality, large amounts of money are devoted to this research and engineering.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Such research stems directly from the current biological dogma that Cetacea are something less than Man, that Cetacea can be trained in the service of Man, that Cetacea have no culture of their own, no intelligence, no sentience, no compassion.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The present laws, which include Cetacea, assume that they are "an economic resource for the use of Man."
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Such laws are epitomized in the United States Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and in the Endangered Species Act of 1973.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The International Whaling Commission is founded on this same belief system, i.e., that the other species are for the economic exploitation of Man. 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Currently there are several tens of groups of persons who wish "to conserve the species of Earth" including the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    There is, for instance, a strong antiwhaling movement.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Most of these groups are staffed by compassionate human beings who fight against the killing of the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Insofar as can be determined, they are not united.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    From group to group the philosophies vary.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    None have come straight out in a public display of belief in the high intelligence, the compassion, and the cultural attainments of the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    There are a few members of the younger generation who believe in the intelligence and ancient wisdom of the dolphins and whales.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These people are very much in the minority.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The current scientific consensus about the dolphins and the whales is generated by zoologists and biologists who cannot believe in, and therefore do not write about, the high intelligence of the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Such ideas are relegated to those enthusiastic younger people who have not been trained in the dogma of biological traditions.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    There is a fair number of individuals working for the appreciation of the intelligence of the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Many of these individuals have communicated with John.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Most of them have asked him not to give their names publicly.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Given the present human consensus reality and the published scientific dogma, these individuals do not feel that it is yet appropriate to acknowledge the new belief system in public.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    If the trends of the past continue, there is no future for the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The whaling industry has assured the demise of the older, larger whales who contain the cetacean wisdom of the past and have taught it to the younger Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In the last century there were sperm whales up to eighty feet in length; currently, none have been seen larger than fifty feet.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The obvious conclusion is that the old sperm whales are gone and that with them a good deal of the sperm-whale knowledge and wisdom has been extinguished.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    One can assume not only that the older whales educate the younger ones but that there is also interspecies communication in the sea among the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Man has missed the opportunity to share in this ancient culture; the ancient cultures in the New World were eliminated in a similar fashion during the Spanish conquest of Mexico and South America.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Mayan, Aztec, and Inca civilizations and records were destroyed as heretical and non-Christian.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    So the Cetacean culture may have been, or soon will be, destroyed.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John shook himself, attempting to get out of the pessimistic despair into which he was thrown by a review of these facts.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Enmeshed in thoughts and feelings about Man's inhumanity to Man, Man's inhumanity to other species, he found it difficult to conceive of alternatives for the future of the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He thought, "What is the meaning of humanity, of humanitarian?
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These words are derived from Man's ideals about his own nature.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    'Humanitarian' has come to imply high ideals.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    When applied to Man's relations to the animals this concept assumes that somehow or other Man is superior to the other species.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In colleges and universities, the humanities are the studies of Man himself and his literary productions about himself.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    With such labels Man chases his own tail, his own past.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The self-referential nature of Man's studies is excruciatingly obvious."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John thought, "Our task is not to be humanitarians, not so much to participate in conservation of species as to be willing, positive participants in the future evolution of all species, including Man, upon the planet Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Man must come down from his throne and realize that his future is coextensive with the future of all species.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Instead of functioning as a reluctant caretaker, the zookeeper of Earth, it is time for Man to change his beliefs and become what he is, another species that desires survival not at the expense of but in concert with the other organisms of the planet.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    "Alternative futures for Man, then, need an opening of his communication systems, currently devoted exclusively to interhuman problems, to include the other capable species in his communication.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Man needs a new humility, a new belief in the abilities of these species to communicate with him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He needs to be freed of his suffering from interspecies deprivation."
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    John felt his own head, the size of his brain.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He realized the small size of the brains of all humans.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He visualized the size of the brains of dolphins, the huge brains of the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He was aware of his own small mind compared with the huge minds resident in the brains of dolphins and whales.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    He thought, "Let me forget the barriers to alternative futures for us.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Let me forget pessimism in regard to those futures.
  :Русский: |-

    At the beginning, these are young dolphins who have not yet learned all of dolphin culture.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The young dolphins are confined and then released.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    New young dolphins are captured, taught, and released.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In certain installations the older dolphins begin to approach the human researchers, intrigued by what the younger dolphins have told them about the new breed of Man. The older dolphins try to teach these young humans the dolphin ethics, the dolphin languages.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    The whales begin approaching these groups, informed by the dolphins of what is occurring.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These exchanges are taking place in remote locations, safe from the whalers, and the aggressive human groups.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Over the next few years these young researchers break through into the multiple languages of the Cetacea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They begin to publish the long sagas, the teaching stories of the dolphins and the whales.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They find that these stories go back thirty million years, passed on by the traditions taught by the Cetacea to one another.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    These stories include the total interdependence of the organisms of the sea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They reveal the means by which this interdependence was realized, the reasons why in the sea there is respect among species, a respect not present among the species on land.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The tolerance of the larger-brained species for the smaller-brained ones is elucidated.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The rules of survival as worked out in the sea over a thirty-million-year period are taught to Man. 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In these stories are histories of cataclysms of the planet Earth, huge earthquakes, the shifting of continental masses, the destruction of seas; the violence of the surface of flooded continents is recounted.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The survival over this extended period and the evolution of the large pelagic brains, despite these cataclysms, is carefully explained.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The interconnected oceans allowed sufficient numbers of Cetacea to travel away from the sites of the cataclysms and save themselves to tell these stories to their descendants.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Time after time the species on land have been wiped out while those in the oceans were saved.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The cushioning effects of vast masses of water assured the long-term survival of the increasingly larger brains and their vehicles.
  :Русский: |-

    The whales tell the men stories of their own evolution in the sea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They tell of the demise of the organisms of the land during the cataclysms.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They tell Man of past contacts between his species and theirs: in several remote locations for very short periods of time, they have established contact with early Man. 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The Cetacea tell stories of the arrival of strange vehicles from outer space which landed in the sea.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Many of these bumed up coming through the atmosphere; a few landed intact and their appearance and their occupants are described in the whale stories.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The whales established communication with a few of these arrivals from outer space before the extraterrestrials left again.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Thus the whales have been educated about interplanetary travel by these visitors from beyond Earth.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    Realizing that Man is learning how to travel off the planet, the whales describe to Man the extraterrestrial visitors and their vehicles.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They teach Man the lessons they have learned from these strange life forms from elsewhere.
  :Русский: |-

    The whales suggest new directions for research into space travel.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    They push the evolution of Man's science beyond its present limits.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They furnish Man with hints for means of communication far beyond anything that he has accomplished in his own humancentered science of the past.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The whales teach Man the lesson that survival in the galaxy depends on communication of the basic survival programs for all life, irrespective of its origins.

    The men of that future day solve their national and international disputes in the light of the new knowledge.
  :Русский: |-

    They establish communication with far civilizations elsewhere in the galaxy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They are taught appropriate methods of communication with these civilizations by the whales.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They leam how to join in the networks of communication throughout the galaxy.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They are made aware of the existence of intelligences far greater than that of whale or Man. The men of that future time begin to realize their proper place in the galaxy and then in the universe as a whole.

    The new God of these new men becomes large enough to encompass the whole Universe.

    # Epilogue 
  :Русский: |-

    This book has ended.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The story of life on this planet as we know it continues.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The seeds for the future plants are in the story told in the book.
  :Русский: |-

    The plants of the future grow.
  :Русский: |-

    Will they flower into what the author wishes them to be?

- :Английский: |-
    Only the Earth Coincidence Control Office (ECCO) and its Beings seem to know.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    In the interim, after completion of the book, much happened to John and Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They became immersed in the creation of the program to test the mutual intelligence of Cetaceans and humans (including themselves).
  :Русский: |-

    The bare essential beginnings of the human-dolphin tests, under way.

    Through the help of friends, a computer has been purchased, put into operation, and the necessary software research initiated.

    John and Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    They wondered: Can enough informed, interested, dedicated humans and enough money be found to initiate and to continue the full program of interspecies communication?
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    As they recount in The Dyadic Cyclone, chapter Zero, human agents of ECCO are required to exert their best efforts, their best intelligence, in the service of BCCO; to expect the unexpected every minute, hour, day, week of their lives, ECCO controls long-term coincidence patterns; agents are expected to control short-term ones.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    With their friends, John and Toni worked on the short-term coincidence patterns; they made real the dream of communication with dolphins, porpoises, and whales through computer sessions of learning with them.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    A new book also seems to be gestating; so life continues, etc., etc., etc., to its future ending.

    # Friends 
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Many years ago I found out where John Lilly lived and, uninvited, went to see him.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    He is a very private man, still he received me and we became friends.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    In fact, almost as a member of his family.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    I followed the events described in his books Center of the Cydone, Deep Self, and, more recently, The Scientist.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Presently I am trying, as best I can, to be of practical assistance to him through the Human/ Dolphin Foundation, which a few of us established three years ago.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    This foundation is located in a high canyon above the Malibu Hills in southern California.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    It is near the residence of John Lilly and his wife, Toni.
  :Русский: |-
    
-
- :Английский: |-
    From time to time Toni and John take off to give a lecture and / or workshop orfor a social visit; but mostly, for seven days out of the week, they attend the data that is being accumulated and the blueprints that are being drawn for Project Janus (Interspecies Communication with Cetaceans).
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    Adjacent to the Lilly house is a small one-and-a-half room laboratory.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    Here, five days a week, a handful of young scientists, who have come from different parts of the United States and Canada, work, without pay, under Lilly's supervision, or, more simply, to work on the various computers, hydrophones, and calculating paraphernalia that the foundation has purchased (which you have read about in this book), and to prepare the results for scientific testing.

    One feels privileged to be in the vicinity of this activity.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    The word is out that important steps are being taken, and, indeed, important people come and go.
  :Русский: |-

- :Английский: |-
    The implications of a possible breakthrough in establishing communication with an alien species whose brain size is larger than our own (whether on this planet or another) are enormous, and the consequences of finally ending what has been called the "long loneliness of man" on this Earth, in our time, would, of course, be epic.

    What it amounts to is that we are in a race to speak to the whales and dolphins before they are destroyed.

    The late John Steinbeck wrote in The Sea of Carter.

    "It is a good thing for a man to look down at the tide-pools, then up to the stars, then back to the tide-pools again."
  :Русский: |-

    John Lilly has put it another way, and it was this statement that drew many of us to him: "In the province of the mind, what one believes to be true either is true or becomes true within certain limits.
  :Русский: |-
    
- :Английский: |-
    These limits are found to be beliefs to be transcended."
